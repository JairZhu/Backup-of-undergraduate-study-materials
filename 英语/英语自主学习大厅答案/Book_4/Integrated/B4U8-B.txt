    Script:         A trip’s success often depends on what you bring with you and how you bring it. One packing essential is researching the destination’s temperatures and precipitation. Running around cold and wet Paris in January would have been miserable had I not had warm and sturdy boots. When beginning to pack, consider the trip activities. If it is a business trip, one does not need shredded jeans or a bikini. If you are going on a vacation to Fiji, a business suit is unnecessary.
            While personal style is important, one must consider a destination’s tastes and cultural mores. If the destination is conservative, e.g. the Middle East, consider covering up. Conversely, glitzy Las Vegas is the perfect place to bring everything latex, sequined, metallic or reflective. Pack a range of clothes, all of which match each other. Clothing should not require considerable care. No one wants to be up all night ironing one’s suit or fretting if the hotel staff will return a shirt in time for the morning meeting.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            The past ages of man have all been carefully labeled by anthropologists. When the time comes for anthropologists to turn their attention to the twentieth century, they will surely choose the label “Legless Man”.
            Histories of the time will go something like this: “in the twentieth century, people forgot how to use their legs. Men and women moved about in cars, buses and trains from a very early age. There were lifts and escalators in all large buildings to prevent people from walking. The surprising thing is that they didn’t use their legs even when they went on holiday. They built cable railways, ski-lifts and roads to the top of every huge mountain. All the beauty spots on earth were marred by the presence of large car parks.”
            The future history books might also record that we were deprived of the use of our eyes. In our hurry to get from one place to another, we failed to see anything on the way. Air travel gives you a bird’s-eye view of the world D or even less if the wing of the aircraft happens to get in your way. When you travel by car or train a blurred image of the countryside constantly smears the windows. And as for sea travel, it hardly deserves mention. It is perfectly summed up in the words of the old song: “I joined the navy to see the world, and what did I see? I saw the sea.” The typical twentieth-century traveler is the man who always says “I’ve been there.” You mention the remotest, most evocative place and someone is bound to say “I’ve been there” D meaning, “I drove through it at 100 miles an hour on the way to somewhere else.”
            When you travel at high speeds, the present means nothing: you live mainly in the future because you spend most of your time looking forward to arriving at some other place. By traveling like this, you suspend all experience; the present ceases to be a reality: you might just as well be dead. The traveler on foot, on the other hand, lives constantly in the present. For him traveling and arriving are one and the same thing: he arrives somewhere with every step he makes. He experiences the present moment with his eyes, his ears and the whole of his body. At the end of his journey he feels a delicious physical weariness. He knows that sound. Satisfying sleep will be his: the just reward of all true travelers.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            The tourist trade is booming. With all this coming and going, you’d expect greater understanding to develop between the nations of the world. Superb systems of communication make it possible for us to visit each other’s countries at a moderate cost. What was once the “grand tour”, reserved for only the very rich, is now within everybody’s grasp? The package tour and chartered flights are not to be sneered at. Modern travelers enjoy a level of comfort which the lords and ladies on grand tours in the old days couldn’t have dreamed of. But what’s the sense of this mass exchange of populations if the nations of the world remain basically ignorant of each other?        
            Many tourist organizations are directly responsible for this state of affairs. They deliberately set out to protect their clients from too much contact with the local population. The modern tourist leads a cosseted, sheltered life. He lives at international hotels, where he eats his international food and sips his international drink while he gazes at the natives from a distance. Conducted tours to places of interest are carefully censored. The tourist is allowed to see only what the organizers want him to see and no more. A strict schedule makes it impossible for the tourist to wander off on his own; and anyway, language is always a barrier, so he is only too happy to be protected in this way. At its very worst, this leads to a new and hideous kind of colonization. The sad thing about this situation is that it leads to the persistence of national stereotypes. We don’t see the people of other nations as they really are, but as we have been brought up to believe they are. You can test this for yourself. Take five nationalities, say, French, German, English, American and Italian. Now in your mind, match them with these five adjectives: musical, amorous, cold, pedantic, native. Far from providing us with any insight into the national characteristics of the peoples just mentioned, these adjectives actually act as barriers. So when you set out on your travels, the only characteristics you notice are those which confirm your preconceptions. You come away with the highly unoriginal and inaccurate impression that, say, “Anglo-Saxons are hypocrites” of that “Latin peoples shout a lot”. You only have to make a few foreign friends to understand how absurd and harmful national stereotypes are. But how can you make foreign friends when the tourist trade does its best to prevent you?



    36.
    	
    What’s the theme of this passage?
    A) Tourism contributes nothing to increasing understanding between nations.  
    B) Tourism is tiresome.  
    C) Conducted tour is dull.  
    D) Tourism really does something to one’s country.
