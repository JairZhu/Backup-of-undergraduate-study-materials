    Section B 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: In 1882, Helen Keller caught a fever that was so fierce she nearly died. This 19-month-old girl survived but the fever left its mark ― she could no longer see or hear. Luckily Helen was not someone who gave up easily. Soon she began to explore the world by using her other senses. At the age of five, Helen began to realize she was different from other people. She noticed that her family did not use signs like she did but talked with their mouths. She wanted to talk but no matter how she tried she could not make herself understood. This made her so angry that she used to hurl herself around the room, kicking and screaming in frustration. By the age of seven she had invented over 60 different signs by which she could talk to her family.
    Just before her seventh birthday, the family hired a private tutor ― Anne Sullivan. Anne was careful to teach Helen especially those subjects in which she was interested. As a result Helen became gentler and she soon learnt to read and write in Braille. She also learnt to read people's lips by pressing her finger-tips against them and feeling the movement and vibrations. She also learnt to speak, a major achievement for someone who could not hear at all. While she was still at Radcliffe College she wrote The Story of My Life. This was an immediate success. She toured the country, giving lecture after lecture. Many books were written about her and several plays and films were made about her life. Eventually she became so famous that she was invited abroad and received many honours from foreign universities and monarchs.
    After her death in 1968, an organization was set up in her name to combat blindness in the developing world. Today that agency, Helen Keller International, is one of the biggest organizations working with blind people overseas.
