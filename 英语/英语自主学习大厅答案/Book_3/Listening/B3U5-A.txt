    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         For most of us, owing thousands of dollars in student loans, all while dealing with crushing credit card debt, probably sounds like a nightmare. But for people in their early- to mid-20s, all that debt actually seems to boost their self-esteem ― possibly because they consider that debt an investment in their future. So says a study in the journal Social Science Research.
            Researchers analyzed ongoing national survey data on 3,000 young Americans. The questions covered student loans and credit card debt, as well as some designed to measure the respondents' self-esteem and sense of control over their lives. Even after accounting for the fact that more self-confident teens might be willing to take out more loans in college, the researchers found that the more debt respondents had, the more empowered they felt. Especially young adults from low-income families, who might have been afforded opportunities beyond their means.
            But the honeymoon appears to end around age 28 ― right around the time when college grads have been working a few years and they realize their salary expectations may have been just a bit too high. Oh, and when the bills for those student loans start showing up.
    12.
    	
    A) They think it is a nightmare.  
    B) They do not want to have student loans.  
    C) They think the debt seems to boost their self-esteem.  
    D) They are afraid of paying the debts.

    A) 2,000.  
    B) 3,000.  
    C) 4,000.  
    D) 5,000.  
    Script: How many students are included in the study?

    正确答案： B
    14.
    	
    A) To indicate that the young people get married late.  
    B) To indicate that young graduates realize the reality that it is not easy to pay back the loan.  
    C) To indicate that the loan is to help them get started in their life as an adult.  
    D) To indicate that the young students should not have any student loans.  
    Script: Why does the speaker use the metaphor of "the honeymoon appears to end around 28"?

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Once upon a time there were three young men, who wanted to look for treasures in the desert.
            One day, they started out and went to the sands for their treasures. They brought enough food and some water with them.
            As it was very hot in the sands, they drank up all the water three days later. They were all tired and thirsty. Just then they met a white-haired old man and asked him for help.
            "You can find what you want after turning on the left and right for several times", said the old man, "but don't forget to bring something for yourselves when you get back."
            With the old man's words, the three young men went on with their hard travel. It wasn't long before they found an oasis just as expected. They cheered up and ran to the oasis happily. There, they had a good drink of its clear well water. After full of drinking and eating, it was getting dark. At this moment, the three young men recalled what the old man had told them.
            The first young man said, "What can I bring with me? There's nothing but lots of sands and cactuses." He didn't know what to do and took nothing.
            The second young man thought, "It may be reasonable for the old man's word, I should bring something." He looked around and put a handful of sand in his pocket.
            The third young man thought, "It must be reasonable and important for the old man's words." So he filled the food bag full of sand. Then, they were on their way back home .
            It was at the dawn when the three young men walked out of the desert. Suddenly, one of them cried out with great surprise, for he found golden sand in his pocket. But the third young man spoke nothing though he had taken a full bag of golden sand.
            The first man was unlucky, because he took nothing with him.
            The story tells us that you must catch every chance everywhere.

    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         The United Nations says global youth unemployment is at an all-time high. In a recent report, the UN's International Labor Organization says 81 million young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed, and youth unemployment is expected to rise throughout the year. Merri Shaffer is unemployed. She's searching for a job, like many of the 81 million other young people out of work worldwide.
            "I've been looking, I've been hunting, a lot of online research. A lot of job sites that I feel are coming up completely leaving me empty handed," Shaffer says.
            The economic downturn is hitting young people more than others, according to Elena Gastaldo of the UN's International Labor Organization.
            "In these days, young men and women are three times more likely to be unemployed than their older counterpart," Gastaldo notes.
            In developed countries, like here in the U.S., nearly one young person in every six is unemployed. But as the report shows, youth unemployment is a global problem. It affects all types of economies, in every region of the world.

    Script:         Remember, my son, you have to work. Whether you handle a pick or a pen, a wheel-barrow or a set of books, digging ditches or editing a paper, ringing an auction bell or writing funny things, you must work. If you look around you will see the men who are the most able to live the rest of their days without work are the men who work the hardest. Don't be afraid of killing yourself with overwork. It is beyond your power to do that on the sunny side of thirty. They die sometimes, but it is because they quit work at six in the evening, and do not go home until two in the morning. It's the interval that kills, my son. The work gives you an appetite for your meals; it lends solidity to your slumbers, it gives you a perfect and grateful appreciation of a holiday.

            Waiting to do something until you can be sure of doing it exactly right means waiting for ever. One of the greatest advantages anyone can have is the willingness to make a fool of themselves publicly and often. There's no better way to learn and develop. Heck, it's fun too.
