    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            We are all inclined to believe that our generation is more civilized than the generation that preceded ours. From time to time, there is even some substantial evidence that we hold in higher regard such civilized attributes as compassion, pity, remorse (懊悔), intelligence and a respect for the customs of people different from ourselves.
            Why war then?
            Some pessimistic historians think the whole society of man runs in cycles and that one of the phases is war. The optimists, on the other hand, think war is not like an eclipse (日食) or a flood or a spell of bad weather. They believe that it is more like a disease for which a cure could be found if the causes were known.
            Because war is the ultimate drama of life and death stories and pictures of it are more interesting than those about peace. This is so true that all of us, and perhaps those of us in television more than most, are often caught up in the action of war to the exclusion of the ideas of it.
            If it is true, as we would like to think it is, that our age is more civilized than ages past, we must all agree that it’s very strange that in the twentieth century, our century, we have killed more than 70 million of our fellowmen on purpose, at war. It is very strange that since 1900 more men have killed more other men than in any other seventy years in history.
            Probably the reason we are able to do both, that is, believe on the one hand that we are more civilized and on the other hand wage war to kill D is that killing is not so personal an affair as it once was. The enemy is invisible. One man doesn’t look another in the eye and run him through with a sword. The enemy dead or alive is largely unseen. He is killed by remote control: a loud noise, a distant puff of smoke and then silence.
            The pictures of the victim’s wife and children, which he carries in his breast pocket, are destroyed with him. He is not heard to cry out. The question of compassion or pity or remorse does not enter into it. The enemy is not a man; he is a statistic. It is true, too, that more people are being killed at war now than previously because we’re better at doing it than we used to be. One man with one modern weapon can kill thousands.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Given a good shopping position and the right amount of money available, an educated person ought to be able to make a small, steady living out of a bookshop. It is not a difficult trade to learn and the large chain-stores can never force the small independent bookseller out of existence as they have done to the corner shop and the local milkman. But the hours of work are very long D I was only a part-time employee, but my employer put in a seventy-hour week, apart from regular journeys out of shopping hours to buy books. It is an unhealthy life too. As a rule a bookshop is very cold in winter, because if it is too warm the windows get steamed up, and a bookseller depends on the display in his windows trying to bring customers into his shop. Books give off more dust and dirtier dust than anything else yet invented, and the top of a book is the place where every fly prefers to die.
            But the real reason why I should not like to be back in the book trade for life is that while I was in it, I lost my love of books. A bookseller cannot always tell the truth about his books, and that gives him a dislike for them; still worse is the fact that he is always dusting them and moving them to-and-fro. There was a time when I really did love books D loved the sight and smell and feel of them D if they were fifty or more years old, that is. Nothing pleased me quite so much as to buy a bargain lot of them for 50 pence at a country auction sale. There is a peculiar flavor about the knocked-about unexpected books you pick up in that kind of collection; little-known eighteenth-century poets, out-of-date geography books, one or two volumes of forgotten novels. For occasional reading D in your bath, for instance, or late at night when you are too tired to go to sleep D there is nothing as good as a very old picture storybook.
            But as soon as I went to work in the bookshop I stopped buying books. Seen in a mass, five or ten thousand at a time, books were dull and even a little sickening. Nowadays I do buy one occasionally, but only if it is a book that I want to read and can’ t borrow, and I never buy rubbish.



    36.
    	
    What does the author mean in the first sentence of the passage?
    A) If an educated person wants to make a living, he should run a bookshop.  
    B) It is easy for an educated person to earn money by running a bookshop.  
    C) When an educated person is given a good shopping position and a certain amount of money he should open a bookshop.  
    D) If an educated person has proper money and finds a suitable shopping location, he could open a bookshop for steady income.  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    Running a bookshop is a good way to make a living because ________.

    B) there are many corner shops to help  
    C) even the local milkmen come to buy books  
    D) the bookseller is independent  

    正确答案： A
    38.
