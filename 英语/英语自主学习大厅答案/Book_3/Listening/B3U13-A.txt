    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Like a lot of other smart phones nowadays, my phone has a camera. When I take a picture, there is a sound that is made that is just like the sound the cameras of when I was young made ― a long clicking sound. In the old days, before the rapid development of small machines, there were lots of sounds made by the physical movement of a machine's parts. When you took a picture, there was a sound made by the shutter as it opened and closed rapidly. It wasn't something added to the camera; it wasn't extra. It was just a sound the machine made due to the way it was built.
            Digital cameras don't make any sound, or at least, they don't need to. But the makers of digital cameras add the sound you used to hear. Why? Mostly because that is what people are used to hearing, what they associate with taking a picture. And we are slow to change. We want to feel comfortable with the new technology, so keeping some of the old sounds, shapes, and the "look" of previous technology has become quite common. When you move from one page to another on an iPad, you see something that looks like a paper page turning. For most of us, that's what reading a book feels like, and we want to keep that experience even when it is no longer necessary.
            This process of keeping some of the old to help people transition to new technology is itself old. When we moved from a system of transportation provided by horses to the steam engines of the 19th century, the amount of power was called "horsepower," since that was what people were familiar with. And we continue to use that term in English, even though most of us have probably never ridden a horse and have no idea how much power could be provided by, for example, 140 horses.
            There are many examples of this way of designing technology D think of "folders" on your computer, or putting things in the "trash" to delete them. Can you think of others? Are there sounds that you don't hear anymore that you wish you did?
    12.
    	
    A) It is made by the physical movement of the machine.  
    B) The sound is added to the camera.  
    C) It is designed as a music piece.  
    D) The sound is not extra.  
    Script: Where does the sound of a digital camera come from?

    正确答案： B
    13.
    	
    A) Because people are used to hearing the sound and slow to change.  
    B) Because people are fond of the music.  
    C) Because the sounds are made by the machine itself and cannot be avoided.  
    D) Because the sounds are meant to be fancy.  
    Script: Why does the digital camera have a sound?

    正确答案： A
    14.
    	
    A) iPad page turning.  
    B) Reading a book.  
    C) The use of the term of horsepower.  
    D) The folders on computers.  
    Script: What is not mentioned as examples of old traditions kept like digital camera's shutter sound?

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Benjamin Franklin was born on January 17, 1706 in Boston, Massachusetts. His accomplishments as a scientist, publisher and statesman are particularly remarkable when considered in the context of colonial North America, which lacked the cultural and commercial institutions to nourish original ideas. He dedicated himself to the improvement of everyday life for the widest number of people and, in so doing, made a mark on the emerging nation.
            Benjamin Franklin's inventions include bifocal glasses and the iron furnace stove, a small device with a sliding door which burns wood on a grate, thus allowing people to cook food and heat their homes at the same time.
            Mid-eighteenth century scientists and inventors considered electricity to be Franklin's most remarkable area of investigation and discovery. In his famous experiment using a key and a kite during a thunderstorm, Franklin (working with his son) tested his hypothesis that lightning bolts are actually powerful electrical currents. This work led to the invention of the lightning rod which had the dramatic effect of preventing structures from igniting and burning as the result of being struck by lightning.

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Computer engineer, Ray Tomlinson invented internet based email in late 1971. Ray Tomlinson worked as a computer engineer for Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), the company hired by the United States Defense Department to build the first Internet in 1968.
            Ray Tomlinson was experimenting with a popular program he wrote called SNDMSG that the ARPANET programmers and researchers were using on the network computers to leave messages for each other. SNDMSG was a "local" electronic message program. You could only leave messages on the computer that you were using for other persons using that computer to read. Tomlinson used a file transfer protocol that he was working on called CYPNET to adapt the SNDMSG program so it could send electronic messages to any computer on the ARPANET network.

    The @ Symbol
    Ray Tomlinson chose the @ symbol to tell which user was "at" what computer. The @ goes in between the user's login name and the name of his/her host computer.

    First Email
    The first email was sent between two computers that were actually sitting besides each other. However, the ARPANET network was used as the connection between the two. The first email message was "QWERTYUIOP".
