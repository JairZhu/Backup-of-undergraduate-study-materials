    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            We are all inclined to believe that our generation is more civilized than the generation that preceded ours. From time to time, there is even some substantial evidence that we hold in higher regard such civilized attributes as compassion, pity, remorse (懊悔), intelligence and a respect for the customs of people different from ourselves.
            Why war then?
            Some pessimistic historians think the whole society of man runs in cycles and that one of the phases is war. The optimists, on the other hand, think war is not like an eclipse (日食) or a flood or a spell of bad weather. They believe that it is more like a disease for which a cure could be found if the causes were known.
            Because war is the ultimate drama of life and death stories and pictures of it are more interesting than those about peace. This is so true that all of us, and perhaps those of us in television more than most, are often caught up in the action of war to the exclusion of the ideas of it.
            If it is true, as we would like to think it is, that our age is more civilized than ages past, we must all agree that it’s very strange that in the twentieth century, our century, we have killed more than 70 million of our fellowmen on purpose, at war. It is very strange that since 1900 more men have killed more other men than in any other seventy years in history.
            Probably the reason we are able to do both, that is, believe on the one hand that we are more civilized and on the other hand wage war to kill D is that killing is not so personal an affair as it once was. The enemy is invisible. One man doesn’t look another in the eye and run him through with a sword. The enemy dead or alive is largely unseen. He is killed by remote control: a loud noise, a distant puff of smoke and then silence.
            The pictures of the victim’s wife and children, which he carries in his breast pocket, are destroyed with him. He is not heard to cry out. The question of compassion or pity or remorse does not enter into it. The enemy is not a man; he is a statistic. It is true, too, that more people are being killed at war now than previously because we’re better at doing it than we used to be. One man with one modern weapon can kill thousands.



    31.

    A) people are more cruel  
    B) people don’t care others’ lives

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            During your education you may have to study some subjects that do not interest you or that do not seem to have any value. Nevertheless, they are subjects that must be studied and passed. It is helpful to realize, as a matter of fact, that any subject is of interest and value. Many people have found it interesting and have even made a career of the subject. It is you who have no interest. How can you develop interest?
            First, think of how and why the subject is important to your general education. Physics may not seem interesting to you, but if you want to understand space exploration, a little physics will be helpful. Biology may not seem interesting to you, but if you are curious about the anatomy and function of your body, a little biology will be useful. The extent and variety of your interests help you to understand the modern world and to measure your growth as an educated, well-rounded person.
            Second, think of how the subject is related to other subjects or to other times, places, problems, and purposes. Although your study schedule is broken into separate and individual courses, you are not learning isolated information or ideas. Ancient history has some relationship to current events; physics and philosophy are closely connected in many ways; mathematics is useful in economics; psychology and sociology are reflected in literature. A subject that does not seem interesting in itself may be very interesting in relation to other subjects.
            Third, interest depends upon understanding. If you do not understand the rules of baseball or cricket, you cannot have much interest in watching the game. But if you take time and trouble to learn the rules, you may find it an exciting sport. When you begin to study a new subject, try to keep an open mind. Do not start by thinking the subject is boring or difficult. Most of all, do not fall behind in your preparation, reading, classwork, and homework. When you fail to learn one point of information, all of the following information that depends on it will not be clear to you. Because you do not understand, you will lose whatever interest you may have started with. To maintain interest and concentration, study regularly and do not be afraid to ask questions or seek help for anything which you do not understand.



    36.
    	
    According to the passage, an educated, well-rounded person ______.
    A) must know why the subject is important to his general education  
    B) is always curious about the anatomy and function of his body  
    C) is characterized by the extent and variety of his interests  
    D) knows how to help others to understand the modern world  

    正确答案： C
    37.
    	
    The author suggests that we not refuse the subject which does not seem interesting in itself because ______.
    A) it may be very important to our general education  
    B) it is interesting in relation to history  
    C) it must be studied and passed  
    D) it can help a person to make a career  

    正确答案： A
    38.
    	
    According to the author, if you want to develop interest in a subject, you should ______.
    A) spend time learning the rules  
    B) not ask for help from others  
    C) keep on asking questions all the time  
    D) try to learn it well from the very beginning  

    正确答案： D
    39.
    	
    Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?
    A) A subject which you are not interested in can be of great interest to others.  
    B) Many subjects are closely related to each other.  
    C) A football fan should know the rules of football first.  
    D) If you are not interested in a subject, you need not learn it.  

    正确答案： D
    40.
    	
    The best title for the passage is “______”.
    A) How to Develop Interest  
    B) The Importance of Every Subject  
    C) The Relationship Between Interest and Understanding  
    D) The Importance of Interest  

    正确答案： A
