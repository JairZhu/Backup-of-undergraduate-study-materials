$HEAD_LAYOUT_MAIN$=Application Overview

$DESC_LAYOUT_MAIN$::
The user interface of FTP Voyager JV makes it easier than ever to navigate a file system.  By using a familiar and simple layout
users can quickly begin to navigate through their file system.  A significant addition to the layout is the introduction of the
"$LINK_DOCKING_FRAMEWORK$".  The "docking framework" allows the user to look at two different parts of the same file system.  Users can also change the location of "dockable frames and/or toolbars" to create a customizable workspace.  This creates a very simple
intuitive file transfer client tailored to each user of Serv-U.
::END

$DESC_PANE_LOCAL_REMOTE$::
The local and remote panes allow the user to quickly navigate through a file system.  Each pane has a similar layout which eases
the user into a comfortable transition between the two file systems.  The panes also inherit the functionality of the
"$LINK_DOCKING_FRAMEWORK$", which allows the user to customize the layout of each pane.  Each local panel shows the contents of
the client's local file system and each remote panel shows the contents of the server's remote file system.
::END

$HEAD_LOCAL_PANE$=Local Pane

$QUESTION_WEL_MSG_DLG$=Why does a Welcome Message appear after I login with my web browser?
$ANSWER_WEL_MSG_DLG$::
User accounts in Serv-U can be configured to receive Welcome Messages.  If your user account is setup with one, it is
received after successfully logging on to the File Server.
::END

$QUESTION_NEED_JRT$::
Why do I need the Java Runtime installed to use FTP Voyager JV?
::END
$ANSWER_NEED_JRT$::
FTP Voyager JV was written with the Java programming language.  Because Java is an interpreted language, the Java Runtime
is necessary for it to run.  The latest version of the JRE is available $LINK_JAVA_RUNTIME$ here.
::END

$QUESTION_CERTIFICATE$::
Why do I have to accept a certificate in order to run FTP Voyager JV?
::END
$ANSWER_CERTIFICATE$::
FTP Voyager JV needs full access to the local file system in order to upload and download files to Serv-U.  Java applications
that request these permissions must be digitally signed with a certificate.  FTP Voyager JV is signed using Rhino Software, Inc.'s
developer certificate provided by Comodo, a trusted certification authority.  This guarantees that FTP Voyager JV is a genuine
product of Rhino Software, Inc. and it is safe to allow it to access your system for the purpose of transferring data with
Serv-U.
::END

$QUESTION_PREFERRED_CLIENT_1$::
Is there a way to automatically launch FTP Voyager JV after I login?
::END
$ANSWER_PREFERRED_CLIENT_1$::
Yes.  Please contact the Serv-U administrator and ask them to setup your account with FTP Voyager JV as the <strong>Default Web
Client</strong>.
::END

$QUESTION_PREFERRED_CLIENT_2$::
Is there a way I can go back to selecting which web client I would like to use after I login?
::END
$ANSWER_PREFERRED_CLIENT_2$::
Yes.  Please contact the Serv-U administrator and ask them to setup your account to prompt for a web client instead of using
a <strong>Default Web Client</strong>.
::END

$QUESTION_LIST_DIR_FAILED$::
Why does the remote directory listing fail?
::END
$ANSWER_LIST_DIR_FAILED$::
There could be various reasons why FTP Voyager JV cannot perform a remote directory listing.  Some possible reasons are listed below:
::END
$ANSWER_LIST_DIR_FAILED_LIST$::
The Serv-U File Server is not running.
The Serv-U File Server is not online.
The session between FTP Voyager JV and the Serv-U File Server may have been disconnected.
The user account may not have permission to view the remote directory.
::END
$ANSWER_LIST_DIR_FAILED_CONTD$::
Try closing FTP Voyager JV and logging in to Serv-U again.  If remote directory listings still fail, contact your
Serv-U administrator to confirm your permissions to the directory in question.
::END

$QUESTION_PERMISSIONS$::
Why can't I create a directory, rename a directory, delete a directory, upload files, or download files?
::END
$ANSWER_PERMISSIONS$::
The Serv-U administrator has the capability to assign specific privileges to each user.  The scope of operations for any particular
user account is limited by these privileges.  If errors are displayed trying to perform one of the operations listed above, the dialog
should indicate that the user account logged in does not have the corresponding privilege to perform that action.  If this is in error,
please contact your Serv-U administrator.
::END

$QUESTION_BROWSER_FAIL_ON_LOGOUT$::
Why does the browser fail to communicate with Serv-U when I logout of FTP Voyager JV?
::END
$ANSWER_BROWSER_FAIL_ON_LOGOUT$::
FTP Voyager JV and the browser it was launched from share the same session ID that Serv-U uses to communicate to the
corresponding client. Therefore, after logging out of FTP Voyager JV, the browser it was launched from no longer has a valid
connection to Serv-U.  It is necessary to login again through the browser to establish a new connection to Serv-U.
::END

$QUESTION_CAN_NOT_LOGOUT$::
Why can't I logout of Serv-U?
::END
$ANSWER_CAN_NOT_LOGOUT$::
FTP Voyager JV can logout of Serv-U.  There's an option in the <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog under the $LINK_PREF_PAGE_GENERAL$
tab that allows automatic logout from Serv-U when FTP Voyager JV closes.
::END

$QUESTION_JRT_NETWORK_SETTINGS$::
If I have multiple browsers on my machine, can I use both to launch FTP Voyager JV?
::END
$ANSWER_JRT_NETWORK_SETTINGS$::
Yes.  Both browsers can be used to simultaneously launch FTP Voyager JV.  However, use caution: because the Java Runtime only uses
the proxy settings of the "default" browser, FTP Voyager JV may use the wrong proxy settings.  For instance, if your default browser
is Internet Explorer, which is setup to use a proxy server, then FTP Voyager JV also uses these proxy settings even if it was launched
by Mozilla Firefox.
