    Questions 6 to 8 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

    Script: Woman: Professor, what do you think about foreign species and their influence on biodiversity?
    Man: The rich diversity of unique species across many parts of the world exist only because they are separated by barriers, particularly large rivers, seas, oceans, mountains and deserts from other species of other land masses.
    Woman: Are humans doing everything to protect those natural barriers and trying to protect all those exotic species?
    Man: These barriers that couldn't have been easily crossed by natural processes, except through continental drift. However, humans have invented transportation with the ability to bring different species into contact.
    Woman: Are foreign species a threat to biodiversity?
    Man: The widespread introduction of foreign species by humans is a powerful threat to biodiversity.
    Woman: Why are the introductions made by mankind a threat?
    Man: Well, when foreign species are introduced to ecosystems and establish self-sustaining populations, the local species in that ecosystem that have not evolved to cope with the foreign species may not survive.
    Woman: O, my!
    Man: Yes, you see, sometimes the introduced animal may wipe out the local species completely. Europe, for example is now having a problem of invading Asian bees, which are larger in size, and more aggressive than the local European bees.
    6.
    	
    A) Because the local species are strong.  
    B) Because the natural barriers such as large rivers, seas, mountains and deserts separate different species.  
    C) Because there are too many natural enemies to every species.  
    D) Because the nature is full of wonders.  
    Script: According to the professor, why does the rich diversity of unique species exist across many parts of the world?

    正确答案： B
    7.
    	
    A) When foreign species are introduced, the local species in that ecosystem may not be able to cope with the foreign ones.  
    B) When foreign species are introduced, the local landforms may change totally.  
    C) When foreign species are introduced, the foreign species may grow very fast and take up the space.  
    D) When foreign species are introduced, the local species may not find enough food.  
    Script: Why is the foreign species a powerful threat to biodiversity?

    正确答案： A

    B) Local flowers are losing their diversity.  
    C) Local farmers are suffering from the reduced production of honey.  
    D) The Asian bees are wiping out the local European bees.  
    Script: What is the problem in Europe these days?

    正确答案： D
    Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

    Script: Woman: I have heard that many animals in this world are becoming extinct.
    Man: Yeah. The number of tigers, birds, and sea animals are all declining. We are losing them at a very fast speed.
    Woman: O, my! That is not good at all. What are the causes for the disappearance of these animals？
    Man: Well, human activities are the main reasons. Global warming is also considered to be a major threat to global biodiversity. For example coral reefs D which are biodiversity hotspots will be lost in 20 to 40 years if global warming continues at the current trend.
    Woman: Isn't that a lot of countries have already made policies to preserve the natural environment and species?
    Man: That's true, but I am afraid we are still losing the biodiversity of both plants and animals. In 2004, an international collaborative study on four continents estimated that 10 percent of species would become extinct by 2050 because of global warming.
    Woman: I guess we need to limit climate change or we will wind up with a lot of species in trouble, possibly extinct.

    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         The November 26th issue of the journal Science included a study showing that the extinction of the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago allowed small mammals to get really big. But well before all that happened, another event triggered a different burst of evolutionary activity.
            A new study finds that about 300 million years ago, the tropical rainforests along the equator fell apart. The familiar reason ― global warming.
            Present-day Europe and North America were on the equator back then, and were covered with rainforests. But global warming made things even hotter and drier.
            The expansive rainforests broke up into smaller fragments, and reptile populations became isolated from each other in the fragments. Such geographical isolation allows different populations to evolve in different directions, which led to a great increase in animal diversity. The research appears in the journal Geology.
            The explosion in reptiles ultimately led to the evolution of the dinosaurs, which dominated the planet until they fell victim to the massive impact that allowed us mammals to take over.
    12.
    	
    A) Some 55 million years ago.  
    B) Some 26 million years ago.  
    C) Some 300 million years ago.  
    D) Some 65 million years ago.  
    Script: According to the passage, when did the dinosaurs get extinct?

    正确答案： D
    13.
    	
    A) The dinosaurs get extinct.  
    B) The tropical rainforest along the equator fell apart.  
    C) The global warming started.  
    D) The ice sheet melted.  
    Script: What happened about 300 million years ago?

    正确答案： B
    14.
    	
    A) It allows different rainforest grow.  
    B) It allows different reptile (爬行动物) populations to evolve in different directions.  
    C) It allows the rainforest to fall apart.  
    D) It allows the climate to change.  
    Script: What does geographical isolation allow?

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Crop diversity aids recovery when the dominant plant is attacked by a disease or predator:
            The Irish potato disaster of 1846 was a major factor in the deaths of one million people and the emigration of another million. It was the result of planting only two potato varieties, both vulnerable to the blight.
            When rice grassy virus struck rice fields from Indonesia to India in the 1970s, 6,273 varieties were tested for resistance. Only one was resistant, an Indian variety, and known to science only since 1966. This variety formed a hybrid with other varieties and is now widely grown.
            Coffee rust attacked coffee plantations in Sri Lanka, Brazil, and Central America in 1970. A resistant variety was found in Ethiopia. Although the diseases are themselves a form of biodiversity.
            Although about 80 percent of humans' food supply comes from just 20 kinds of plants, humans use at least 40,000 species. Many people depend on these species for food, shelter, and clothing. Earth's surviving biodiversity provides resources for increasing the range of food and other products suitable for human use, although the present extinction rate shrinks that potential.
    15.
    	
    A) The failure of the government.  
    B) The earthquake.

    正确答案： A

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         The term "biological diversity" was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist Raymond F. Dasmann in the 1968 book A Different Kind of Country, advocating conservation. The term was widely adopted only after more than a decade, when in the 1980s it came into common usage in science and environmental policy. Thomas Lovejoy, in the foreword to the book Conservation Biology, introduced the term to the scientific community. By the early 1980s TNC's Science program and its head, Robert E. Jenkins, Lovejoy and other leading conservation scientists at the time in America advocated the use of "biological diversity".
            The term's contracted form "biodiversity" may have been coined by W.G. Rosen in 1985 while planning the 1986 National Forum on Biological Diversity organized by the National Research Council (NRC). It first appeared in a publication in 1988 when entomologist E. O. Wilson used it as the title of the proceedings of that forum.
            Since this period the term has achieved widespread use among biologists, environmentalists, political leaders, and concerned citizens.
            A similar term in the United States is "natural heritage." It is more accepted by the wider audience interested in conservation. Broader than biodiversity, it includes geology and landforms.
    18.
    	
    A) A wildlife scientist and conservationist.  
    B) A biologist.  
    C) An animal expert.  
    D) A polar explorer.  
    Script: Who used the term "biological diversity" first?

    正确答案： A
    19.
    	
    A) In a paper published by leading conservation scientists.  
    B) In a National Research Council.  
    C) In the title of the proceedings of a National Forum on Biological Diversity.  
    D) In the foreword to the book Conservation Biology.  
    Script: Where was the contracted form "biodiversity" first used?

    正确答案： C
    20.
    	
    A) Because "natural heritage" includes geology and zoology.  
    B) Because "natural heritage" includes geology and landforms.  
    C) Because "natural heritage" includes studies about ocean and land.  
    D) Because "natural heritage" includes studies on American Indians.  
    Script: Why is the term "natural heritage" broader in meaning than "biodiversity"?

    Script:         China has rich biodiversity, boasting the world's largest number of bird species and gymnosperm (裸子植物) varieties. But China's biodiversity is faced with a critical situation: 15 to 20 percent of higher plant varieties are endangered, threatening the existence of 40,000 species of organisms related with them.
            As one of the earliest contracting countries to the Convention on Biological Diversity, China has been active in international affairs concerning the Convention. China is also one of the few countries to complete the Convention's action plans. The China Action Plan for Biodiversity Conservation, implemented in 1994, provided rules and regulations for many eco-environmental protection activities. According to the Law on the Protection of Wildlife, the highest punishment for crimes of damaging wildlife resources is the death penalty.
            Emphasizing effective protection of biological resources, government departments have built and commissioned facilities for preserving genetic resources. In January 2003, the Chinese Academy of Sciences initiated a project to save endangered plants. The project involves over 300 million yuan investment into collection of rare and endangered plants, and the building of gene banks, with the Qinling Mountains, Wuhan, Xishuangbanna and Beijing as the centers.
            Biodiversity is the degree of variation of life forms within a given ecosystem or an entire planet. Biodiversity is a measure of the health of ecosystems. Biodiversity is in part a function of climate.
