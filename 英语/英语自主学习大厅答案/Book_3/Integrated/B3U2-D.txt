    Script:         The central theme of Martin Luther King’s campaign for civil rights was non-violence. It worked better for King in the US than it did for Gandhi in India, where independence was accompanied by terrible fighting between Muslims and Hindus (印度教教徒). There are lots of examples in King’s campaign of non-violent protest working. His campaign brought huge publicity and because King taught blacks to meet the whites with love, not hate, it made the whites look silly and evil in the eyes of the world. For example, when students organized lunchtime protests, the world saw white men arresting peaceful blacks because they sat in the wrong seats in a lunch bar in Woolworth’s. When children marched in Birmingham, Alabama, the police used water cannon and dogs against them, arrested them and put them in jail.
            Another important weapon in King’s fight against injustice was publicity. For many poor blacks, life was simply a struggle to feed their families and keep a place to live. King needed to reach all those people and show them that their lives could be better. He made speeches all over America. He held meetings. When he was arrested, news of his arrest was in newspapers around the world. Black African-Americans became radicalized and wanted to fight. Some went further than King wanted, and used violence, as in the Watts Riots (暴动) in 1965 in Los Angeles. But he taught them that they could change things. Publicity then included posters, newspapers, meetings, word of mouth, marches, demonstrations, radio, and early television.

    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            The story of Barack H. Obama is the American story ― values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the   21    that a life so   22    should be lived in service to others.
            After working his way through college with the help of   23    and student loans, President Obama moved to Chicago, where he worked with a group of churches to help   24    communities   25    by the   26    of local steel plants.
            He went on to attend law school, where he became the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review. Upon graduation, he returned to Chicago to help lead a voter registration   27    , teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago, and remain   28    in his community.
            President Obama's years of public service are based around his   29    belief in the ability to unite people around a politics of purpose. As a United States Senator, he reached across the aisle to pass groundbreaking lobbying reform, lock up the world's most dangerous weapons, and bring   30    to government by putting federal spending online.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            In the world of entertainment, TV talk shows have undoubtedly flooded every inch of space on daytime television. Many of us have seen and heard the often recycled topics found on such shows as Jerry Springer and Oprah Winfrey. And anyone who watches them regularly knows that each one varies in style and format. But no two shows are more profoundly opposite in content, while at the same time standing out above the rest, than the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey shows.
            Jerry Springer could easily be considered the king of “trash talk”. The topics on his show are as shocking as shocking can be. For example, the show takes the ever-common talk show themes of love, sex, cheating, guilt, hate, conflict and morality to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is a display and exploitation of society’s moral catastrophes (灾难), yet people are willing to eat up the intriguing predicaments (困境) of other people’s lives.
            Like Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes TV talk show to its extreme, but Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show focuses on the improvement of society and an individual’s quality of life. Topics range from teaching your children responsibility, managing your work weekly, to getting to know your neighbors.
            Compared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being dumped on society. Jerry ends every show with a “final word”. He makes a small speech that sums up the entire moral of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.
            Clear as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show’s main target audience is middle-class Americans. Most of these people have the time, money, and stability to deal with life’s tougher problems. Jerry Springer, on the other hand, has more of an association with the young adults of society. These are 18- to 21-year-olds whose main troubles in life involve love, relationship, sex, money and peers. They are the ones who see some value and lessons to be learned underneath the show's exploitation.
            While the two shows are as different as night and day, both have ruled the talk show circuit for many years now. Each one caters to a different audience while both have a strong following from large groups of fans. Ironically, both could also be considered pioneers in the talk show world.

    31.
    	
    Compared with other TV talk shows, both the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey are _____.
    A) more family-oriented  
    B) unusually popular  
    C) more profound  
    D) relatively formal  

    正确答案： B
    32.
    	
    Though the social problems Jerry Springer talks about appear distasteful, the audience ______.
    A) remain fascinated by them  
    B) are ready to face up to them  
    C) remain indifferent to them  
    D) are willing to get involved in them  

    正确答案： A
    33.

    B) Racist hatred.  
    C) Family budget planning.

    A) ironical  
    B) sensitive  
    C) instructive  
    D) cynical  

    正确答案： C
    35.
    	
    We can learn from the passage that the two talk shows _________________.
    A) have monopolized the talk show circuit  
    B) exploit the weaknesses in human nature  
    C) appear at different times of the day  
    D) are targeted at different audiences  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            There was a time when big-league university presidents really mattered. The New York Times covered their every move. Presidents, the real ones, sought their counsel. For Woodrow Wilson and Dwight Eisenhower, being head of Princeton and Columbia, respectively, was a stepping-stone to the White House. Today, though, the job of college president is less and less removed from that of the Avon lady (except the house calls are made to the doorsteps of wealthy alums).
            Ruth Simmons, the newly installed president of Brown University and the first African American to lead an Ivy League school, is a throwback to the crusading campus leaders of old. She doesn’t merely marshal funds; she invests them in the great educational causes of our day. With the more than $300 million she raised as president of Smith College from 1995 to 2001, Simmons also established an engineering program (the first at any women’s school). At a meeting to discuss the future of Smith’s math department, one professor timidly requested two more discussion sections for his course. Her response: "Dream bigger."
            Her own dream was born in a sharecropper's shack in East Texas where there was no money for books or toys ― she and her 11 siblings each got an apple, an orange and 10 nuts for Christmas. When Simmons won a scholarship to Dillard University, her high school teachers took up a collection so she’d have a coat. She went on to Harvard to earn a Ph.D. in Romance languages.
            Simmons has made diversity her No. 1 campus crusade. She nearly doubled the enrollment of black freshmen at Smith, largely by traveling to high schools in the nation’s poorest ZIP codes to recruit. Concerned with the lives of minority students once they arrive at school, she has fought to ease the racial standoffs that plague so many campuses. In 1993, while vice provost at Princeton, she wrote a now famous report recommending that the university establish an office of conflict resolution to defuse racial misunderstandings before they boiled over.
            Her first task at Brown will be to heal one such rupture last spring after the student paper published an incendiary ad by conservative polemicist David Horowitz arguing that blacks economically benefited from slavery. "There’s no safe ground for anybody in race relations, but campuses, unlike any other institution in our society, provide the opportunity to cross racial lines," says Simmons. "And even if you’re hurt, you can’t walk away. You have to walk over that line."

    36.
    	
    What does the author intend to illustrate with the example of Woodrow Wilson and Dwight Eisenhower?
    A) The president of the first-class university was really very important.  
    B) The presidents gave them some good advice.  
    C) The presidents of the university could easily go to the White House.  
    D) The presidents had more power and authority than Avon ladies.  

    正确答案： A
    37.
    	
    What does the author mean by "the job of college president is less and less removed from that of the Avon lady" (Para. 1)?
    A) College presidents can get their position with the help of the Avon lady.  
    B) The jobs of college presidents and the Avon lady were quite similar.  
    C) College presidents get inspiration from the job of the Avon lady.  
    D) The jobs of college presidents and the Avon lady should be separated.  

    正确答案： B
    38.
