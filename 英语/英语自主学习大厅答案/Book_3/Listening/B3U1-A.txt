But me, I don't have to travel to school. I can stay in bed! All I have to do is go downstairs! And there's no stupid uniform to wear, either. And better food for lunch.

    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         The earliest Mother's Day celebrations can be traced back to the spring celebrations of ancient Greece in honor of Rhea, the Mother of the Gods. During the 1600's, England celebrated a day called "Mothering Sunday," celebrated on the 4th Sunday of Lent. "Mothering Sunday" honored the mothers of England.
            During that time many of the England's poor worked as servants for the wealthy. As most jobs were located far from their homes, the servants would live at the houses of their employers. On Mothering Sunday the servants would have the day off and were encouraged to return home and spend the day with their mothers. A special cake, called the mothering cake, was often brought along to provide a festive touch.
            People began honoring their mothers as well as the church. All across the world, more than 46 countries honor mothers with a special day, but not all nations celebrate on the same day. We honor mothers with cards, candy, flowers and dinner out.

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Parents who have more than two children should be charged a lifelong climate change tax to offset the effect of their extra greenhouse gas emissions, an Australian medical expert has proposed. They should pay 5,000 dollars (4,400 US dollars) a head for each extra child and up to 800 dollars every year thereafter, according to the plan published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
            In contrast, contraceptives and sterilization procedures would be eligible for carbon credits, suggested Professor Barry Walters at the King Edward Memorial Hospital in Perth.
            "Every family choosing to have more than a defined number of children should be charged a carbon tax that would fund the planting of enough trees to offset the carbon cost generated by a new human being," he wrote.
            Walters made his proposal in a letter in which he criticized the government's payment of a 4,000-dollar "baby bonus" in a bid to boost the birth rate in this sparsely populated country of 21 million people.
            Paying parents extra for every baby fuelled more emissions and contributed to global warming, he said, adding that the bonus should be replaced with a "baby levy" in line with the "polluter pays" principle. And Professor Garry Egger, director of the New South Wales Centre for Health Promotion and Research, agreed. "Population remains crucial to all environmental considerations," he said. "The debate (around population control) needs to be reopened as part of a second ecological revolution."

    A) 5,000 dollars.
