    Woman: Oh, good. I can't wait to learn some martial arts so I can beat up anyone who tries anything.
    Man: Well, the best thing we can do in a dangerous situation is to avoid having to fight. It's not a good idea to confront someone who is much stronger than you are. If you can defuse the situation or run away, that would be the best strategy.
    Woman: All right, but if someone is harassing me, I want to be ready to do some damage.
    Man: I'm not sure if that's the right mindset…
    Woman: I always trust my instincts. If my intuition tells me that someone may be dangerous, I want to get in the first punch.

Each time the fighter struck the boy, he fell down, but at once the boy stood up; and each time a punch knocked him down again, then the boy stood up again. Several times later, the teacher asked, "What do you think of your child?"
            "What a shame!" the boy's father said, "I never thought he would be so easily knocked down. I needn't have him left here any longer."

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Welcome to This Is Our Everyday Hero. I'm Barbara Klein.
            Every society has its heroes. This week on our program, we present several stories of heroism in action.
            We start in New York City earlier this month D January fourth, to be exact. Two friends, Julio Gonzalez and Pedro Nevarez, were standing on the street talking. Suddenly, people in a nearby apartment building screamed for help. A three-year-old boy was hanging from the steps of the fire escape outside the building. Timothy Addo was twelve meters above the ground, and scared.
            The men saw that he was going to fall. The two mechanics ran across the street and positioned themselves to catch him. They got there just in time. Timothy lost his hold and dropped. His feet hit Mister Nevarez and pushed him over onto the sidewalk. But the little boy landed in the arms of Mister Gonzalez, who also fell. Timothy was shaken by the experience, but he was safe.
            Experts in human behavior tell us that some situations bring out the best in people. But something made this event all the more newsworthy. Just two days earlier, New York City had another accidental hero.

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         A teenage boy named Xue Xiao got nationwide attention in China last year following the Sichuan earthquake. His claim to fame was simply that his first words after being pulled from the ruins 80 hours after the quake was over were: "I want a Coke, with ice."
            Xue's courage and perseverance held many people in awe. So he was admitted by Shanghai University of Finance and Economics without having to take any exams. An article in Oriental Morning Post covered the boy's latest development in school and reported that he has to study English very hard to keep up with his peers at the university.
            The writer says he is surprised by the school's decision and asks if a student's legendary experience could be a reason for the university to enroll the student without exam scores. It is reasonable to reward people who made outstanding contributions to the earthquake relief efforts, but the boy's involvement is inadequate to be considered a contribution, the article supposed. Indeed, at a time when the country needed optimism to boost national morale, Xue Xiao touched people with his "courage and humor," the writer said. But the university's explanation that "Xue's spirit of rousing himself in the earthquake tallies with the school's motto" is really far-fetched, according to the article.
    18.
    	
    A) For his brave action in saving other children.  
    B) For his naughty behavior in school.  
    C) For his optimistic spirit, perseverance and courage.  
    D) For his earthquake diary.  
    Script: What was Xue Xiao famous for?

    正确答案： C
    19.
    	
    A) He is envied by other students.  
    B) He has to work hard to keep up with others in English learning.  
    C) He has to take part-time jobs to sustain his campus life.  
    D) He was taken by the university without taking examinations.  
    Script: What can be inferred from the passage about Xue's school life at his university?

    正确答案： B
    20.
    	
    A) The reward received by the boy is reasonable.  
    B) The boy's involvement is not a contribution and therefore the reward is not appropriate.  
    C) The boy needs more attention from the public.  
    D) The boy should be encouraged.  
    Script: What is the article's comment on Xue's story in Oriental Morning Post?

    正确答案： B

    Script:         Courage is not only found in the heat of war or the mighty works of brave men and women. Courage is the mother taking care of her sick child in the early morning hours. Courage is the father who shows up on time everyday at a boring, low-paying, dead-end job to feed and clothe his family.
            Courage comes in many forms, not only from thoughts and deeds of greatness, but in the routine, everyday art of living. When life gets you down, when it seems that your world is at an end, take courage and go the next step. You will be amazed at the power and strength you have inside.

    Section A 

    Directions: Interpret the following Chinese passage into English. You can either interpret it sentence by sentence or give out the main points in your own words. You will have TWO minutes for preparation and THREE minutes for interpretation.
    31.	        勇敢，不需要突出的品质，不需要秘诀，不需要天时地利，每个人或早或晚都有机会。生活不过是对勇气进行特别考验的一个竞技场而已，在人生的每一个竞技场上勇气都会前来挑战。

    思考/准备


    Section B 

    Directions: Describe, comment or elaborate on the following pictures, phenomenon, event or epigram. You will have TWO minutes for preparation and THREE minutes for presentation.
    32.	Read the quotation from J. F. Kennedy, and think about your own definition of courage. Talk about the courage as you believe in and give an example.

            The courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment; but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy. A man does what he must ― in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures ― and that is the basis of all human morality.
