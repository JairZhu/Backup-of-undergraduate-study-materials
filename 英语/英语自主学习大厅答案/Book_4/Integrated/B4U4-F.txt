    Script:         Globalization is a process of interaction and integration among the people, companies, and governments of different nations, a process driven by international trade and investment and aided by information technology. This process has effects on the environment, on culture, on political systems, on economic development and prosperity, and on human physical well-being in societies around the world. Globalization is not new, though. For thousands of years, people ― and, later, corporations ― have been buying from and selling to each other in lands at great distances, such as through the famed Silk Road across Central Asia that connected China and Europe during the Middle Ages. Likewise, for centuries, people and corporations have invested in enterprises in other countries. In fact, many of the features of the current wave of globalization are similar to those prevailing before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. But policy and technological developments of the past few decades have spurred increases in cross-border trade, investment, and migration so large that many observers believe the world has entered a qualitatively new phase in its economic development. Since 1950, for example, the volume of world trade has increased by 20 times, and from just 1997 to 1999 flows of foreign investment nearly doubled, from $ 468 billion to $ 827 billion. Distinguishing this current wave of globalization from earlier ones, author Thomas Friedman has said that today globalization is “farther, faster, cheaper, and deeper.”

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            In such a changing, complex society formerly simple solutions to informational needs become complicated. Many of life's problems which were solved by asking family members, friends or colleagues are beyond the capability of the extended family to resolve. Where to turn for expert information and how to determine which expert advice to accept are questions facing many people today.
            In addition to this, there is the growing mobility of people since World War Ⅱ. As families move away from their stable community, their friends of many years, their extended family relationships, the informal flow of information is cut off, and with it the confidence that information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy and reliable. The almost unconscious flow of information about the simplest aspects of living can be cut off. Thus, things once learned subconsciously through the casual communications of the extended family must be consciously learned.
            Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of information. The individual now has more information available than any other generation, and the task of finding that one piece of information relevant to his or her specific problem is complicated, time-consuming and sometimes even overwhelming.
            Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development of technologies which enable the storage and delivery of more information with greater speed to more locations than has ever been possible before. Computer technology makes it possible to store vast amounts of data in machine-readable files, and to program computers to locate specific information. Telecommunications developments enable the sending of messages via television, radio, and very shortly, electronic mail to bombard people with multitudes of messages. Satellites have extended the power of communications to report events at the instant of occurrence. Expertise can be shared worldwide through teleconferencing, and problems in dispute can be settled without the participants leaving their homes and/or jobs to travel to a distant conference site. Technology has facilitated the sharing of information and the storage and delivery of information, thus making more information available to more people.
            In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is of greatest importance. Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-date information to solve the day-to-day problems, the critical problems of their business, social and family life, will survive and succeed. "Knowledge is power" may well be the truest saying and access to information may be the most critical requirement of all people.



    31.
    	
    The word "it" (Para. 2) most probably refers to _______.
    A) the lack of stable communities  
    B) the breakdown of informal information channels  
    C) the increased mobility of families  
    D) the growing number of people moving from place to place  

    正确答案： B
    32.
    	
    The main problem people may encounter today arises from the fact that _______.
    A) they have to learn new things consciously  
    B) they lack the confidence of securing reliable and trustworthy information  
    C) they have difficulty obtaining the needed information readily  
    D) they can hardly carry out casual communications with an extended family  

    正确答案： C
    33.
    	
    From the passage we can infer that _______.
    A) electronic mail will soon play a dominant role in transmitting messages  
    B) it will become more difficult for people to keep secrets in an information era  
    C) people will spend less time holding meetings or conferences  
    D) events will be reported on the spot mainly through satellites

    A) sharing information  
    B) storing and sending information  
    C) providing people with easy access to more information  
    D) all of the above  

    正确答案： D
    35.
    	
    We can learn from the last paragraph that _______.
    A) it is necessary to obtain as much  
    B) people should make the best use of the information  
    C) we should realize the importance of accumulating information  
    D) it is of vital importance to acquire needed information efficiently  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            A strange thing about humans is their capacity for blind rage. Rage is presumably an emotion resulting from survival instinct, but the surprising thing about it is that we do not deploy it against other animals. If we encounter a dangerous wild animal D a poisonous snake or a wild cat D we do not fly into a temper. If we are unarmed, we show fear and attempt to back away; if we are suitably armed, we attack, but in a rational manner not in a rage. We reserve rage for our own species. It is hard to see any survival value in attacking one’s own, but if we take account of the long competition, which must have existed between our own subspecies and others like Neanderthal man D indeed others still more remote from us than Neanderthal man D human rage becomes more comprehensible.
            In our everyday language and behavior there are many reminders of those early struggles. We are always using the words “us and them”. “Our” side is perpetually trying to do down the “other” side. In games we artificially create other subspecies we can attack. The opposition of “us” and “them” is the touchstone of the two-party system of “democratic” politics. Although there are no very serious consequences to many of these modern psychological representations of the “us and them” emotion, it is as well to remember that the original aim was not to beat the other subspecies in a game but to exterminate it.
            The readiness with which humans allow themselves to be regimented has permitted large armies to be formed, which, taken together with the “us and them” blind rage, has led to destructive clashes within our subspecies itself. The First World War is an example in which Europe divided itself into two imaginary subspecies. And there is a similar extermination battle now in Northern Ireland. The idea that there is a religious basis for this clash is illusory, for not even the Pope has been able to control it. The clash is much more primitive than the Christian religion, much older in its emotional origin. The conflict in Ireland is unlikely to stop until a greater primitive fear is imposed from outside the community, or until the combatants become exhausted.



    36.
    	
    A suitable title for this passage would be____.
    A) Why Human Armies Are Formed  
    B) Man’s Anger Against Rage  
    C) The Human Capacity for Rage  
    D) Early Struggles of Angry Man  

    正确答案： C
    37.
    	
    According to the author, the surprising aspect of human anger is ____.
    A) its lengthy and complex development  
    B) a conflict such as is now going on in Northern Ireland  
    C) that we do not fly into a temper more often  
    D) that we reserve anger for mankind  

    正确答案： D
    38.
    	
    The passage suggests that____.
    A) historically, we have created an “us” versus “them” society  
    B) humans have had a natural disinclination toward formal grouping  
    C) the First World War is an example of how man has always avoided domination  
    D) the emotional origin of the war in Ireland is lost in time  

    正确答案： A
    39.
    	
    From the passage we can infer that ____.
    A) the artificial creation of a subspecies unlike us is something that never happens  
    B) games are psychologically unhealthy  
    C) any artificially created subspecies would be our enemy  
    D) the real or imagined existence of an opposing subspecies is inherent in man’s activities

    40.
