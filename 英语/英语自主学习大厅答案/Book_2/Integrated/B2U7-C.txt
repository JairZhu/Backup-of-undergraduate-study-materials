            Another flood of new vocabulary   21    in 1066, when the Normans conquered England. The country now had three languages: French for the   22    , Latin for the churches and English for the common people. With three languages   23    , there were sometimes different terms for the same thing. For example, Anglo-Saxons had the word kingly, but after the Normans, royal and sovereign entered the language as   24    . The extraordinary thing was that French did not replace English. Over three centuries English gradually   25    French, and by the end of the 15th century what had developed was a modified, greatly   26    language ― Middle English ― with about 10,000 "borrowed" French words.

Translations of Greek and Roman classics were   29    the printed page, and with them thousands of Latin words like capsule and habitual, and Greek words like catastrophe and thermometer. Today we still borrow from Latin and Greek to name new   30    , like video, television and cyberspace.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            When a consumer finds that an item she or he bought is faulty or in some other way does not live up to the manufacturer's claim, the first step is to present the warranty (保单), or any other records which might help, at the store of purchase. In most cases, this action will produce results. However, if it does not, there are various means the consumer may use to gain satisfaction.
            A simple and common method used by many consumers is to complain directly to the store manager. In general, the "higher up" the consumer takes his or her complaint, the faster he or she can expect it to be settled. In such a case, it is usually settled in the consumer's favor, assuming he or she has a just claim.
            Consumers should complain in person whenever possible, but if they cannot get to the place of purchase, it is acceptable to phone or write the complaint in a letter.
            Complaining is usually most effective when it is done politely but firmly, and especially when the consumer can demonstrate what is wrong with the item in question. If this cannot be done, the consumer will succeed best by presenting specific information as to what is wrong, rather than by making general statements. For example, "The left speaker does not work at all and the sound coming out of the right one is unclear" is better than "This stereo does not work."
            The store manager may advise the consumer to write to the manufacturer. If so, the consumer should do this, stating the complaint as politely and as firmly as possible. But if a polite complaint does not achieve the desired result, the consumer can go a step further. She or he can threaten to take the seller to court or report the seller to a private or public organization responsible for protecting consumers' rights.

    B) Threaten to take the seller to court.  
    C) Make polite and general statements about the problem.  
    D) Avoid having direct contact with the store manager.  

    正确答案： A

    D) how to deal with complaints from customers  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Taste is such a subjective matter that we don't usually conduct preference tests for food. The most you can say about anyone's preference is that it's one person's opinion. But because the two big cola companies ― Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola are marketed so aggressively, we've wondered how big a role taste preference actually plays in brand loyalty. We set up a taste test that challenged people who identified themselves as either Coca-Cola or Pepsi fans: Find your brand in a blind tasting.
            We invited staff volunteers who had a strong liking for either Coca-Cola Classic or Pepsi, Diet Coke, or Diet Pepsi. These were people who thought they'd have no trouble telling their brand from the other brand.
            We eventually located 19 regular cola drinkers and 27 diet cola drinkers. Then we fed them four unidentified samples of cola one at a time, regular colas for the one group, diet versions for the other. We asked them to tell us whether each sample was Coke or Pepsi; then we analyzed the records statistically to compare the participants' choices with what mere guess-work could have accomplished.
            Getting all four samples right was a tough test, but not too tough, we thought, for people who believed they could recognize their brand. In the end, only 7 out of 19 regular cola drinkers correctly identified their brand of choice in all four trials. The diet-cola drinkers did a little worse ― only 7 of 27 identified all four samples correctly.
            While both groups did better than chance would predict, nearly half the participants in each group made the wrong choice two or more times. Two people got all four samples wrong. Overall, half the participants did about as well on the last round of tasting as on the first, so fatigue, or taste burnout, was not a factor. Our preference test results suggest that only a few Pepsi participants and Coke fans may really be able to tell their favorite brand by taste and price.

    According to the passage the preference test was conducted in order to ________.
    A) find out the role taste preference plays in a person's drinking  
    B) reveal which cola is more to the liking of the drinkers  
    C) show that a person's opinion about taste is mere guess-work  
    D) compare the ability of the participants in choosing their drinks

    37.

    B) there is not much difference in taste between Coca-Cola and Pepsi  
    C) few people had trouble telling Coca-Cola from Pepsi  
    D) people's tastes differ from one another
