            I'd never realized how important daily routine is: dressing for work, sleeping normal hours. I'd never thought I relied so much on co-workers for company. I began to understand why long-term unemployment can be so   21    , why life without an externally supported daily plan can   22    to higher rates of drug   23    , crime, suicide.
            To   24    balance to my life, I force myself back into the   25    world. I call people, arrange to meet with the few remaining friends who haven't fled New York City.

            But sometimes being face to face is too much. I see a friend and her ringing laughter is   29    ― the noise of conversation in the restaurant, unbearable. I make my excuses and   30    . I re-enter my apartment and run to the computer as though it were a place of safety.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            In the 1950s, the pioneers of artificial intelligence (AI) predicted that, by the end of this century, computers would be conversing with us at work and robots would be performing our housework. But as useful as computers are, they're nowhere close to achieving anything remotely resembling these early aspirations for humanlike behavior. Never mind something as complex as conversation: the most powerful computers struggle to reliably recognize the shape of an object, the most elementary of tasks for a ten-month-old kid.
            The problem, the scientists say, is that AI has been trying to separate the highest, most abstract levels of thought, like language and mathematics, and to duplicate them with logical, step-by-step programs. A new movement in AI, on the other hand, takes a closer look at the more roundabout way in which nature came up with intelligence. Many of these researchers study evolution and natural adaptation instead of formal logic and conventional computer programs. The results of these early efforts are as promising as they are peculiar, and the new nature-based AI movement is slowly but surely moving to the forefront of the field.
            Imitating the brain's neural network is a huge step in the right direction, says computer scientist and biophysicist Michael Conrad, but it still misses an important aspect of natural intelligence. "People tend to treat the brain as if it were made up of color-coded transistors," he explains. "But it's not simply a clever network of switches. There are lots of important things going on inside the brain cells themselves."
            Right now, the notion that conventional computers and software are fundamentally incapable of matching the processes that take place in the brain remains controversial. But if it proves true, then the efforts of Conrad and his fellow AI rebels could turn out to be the only game in town.



    31.
    	
    The author says that the powerful computers of today ____ .
    A) are capable of reliably recognizing the shape of an object  
    B) are close to exhibiting humanlike behavior  
    C) are not very different in their performance from those of the 1950's  
    D) still cannot communicate with people in a human language  

    正确答案： D
    32.
    	
    The new trend in artificial intelligence research stems from _____ . 
    A) the shift of the focus of study on the recognition of the shapes of objects  
    B) the belief that human intelligence cannot be duplicated with logical, step-by-step programs  
    C) the aspirations of scientists to duplicate the intelligence of a ten-month-old child  
    D) the efforts made by scientists in the study of the similarities between transistors and brain cells  

    正确答案： B
    33.
    	
    Conrad and his group of AI researchers have been making enormous efforts to_____ . 
    A) find a roundabout way to design powerful computers  
    B) build a computer using a clever network of switches  
    C) find out how intelligence develops in nature  
    D) separate the highest and most abstract levels of thought  

    正确答案： C
    34.
    	
    What's the author's opinion about the new AI movement?
    A) It has created a sensation among artificial intelligence researchers.  
    B) It's a breakthrough in duplicating human thought processes.  
    C) It's more like a peculiar game rather than a real scientific effort.  
    D) It may prove to be in the right direction though nobody is sure of its future prospects.  

    正确答案： D
    35.
    	
    Which of the following is closest in meaning to the phrase “the only game in town” (in Para.4)?
    A) The only approach to building an artificially intelligent computer.  
    B) The only way for them to win a prize in artificial intelligence research.  
    C) The only area worth studying in computer science.  
    D) The only game they would like to play in town.  

    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            It is a devastating prospect. Terrorists electronically break into the computers that control the water supply of a large American city, open and close valves to contaminate the water with untreated sewage or toxic chemicals, and then release it in a devastating flood. As the emergency services struggle to respond, the terrorists strike again, shutting down the telephone network and electrical power grid with just a few mouse clicks. Businesses are paralysed, hospitals are overwhelmed and roads are gridlocked as people try to flee.
            This kind of scenario is invoked by doom-mongers who insist that stepping up physical security since the September 11th attacks is not enough. Road-blocks and soldiers around power stations cannot prevent digital terrorism. "Until we secure our cyber-infrastructure, a few keystrokes and an Internet connection is all one needs to disable the economy and endanger lives," Lamar Smith, a Texas congressman, told a judiciary committee in February.
            It is true that utility companies and other operators of critical infrastructure are increasingly connected to the Internet. But just because an electricity company's customers can pay their bills online, it does not necessarily follow that the company's critical control systems are vulnerable to attack. Control systems are usually kept entirely separate from other systems, for good reason. They tend to be obscure, old-fashioned systems that are incompatible with Internet technology anyhow.
            On September 18th Richard Clarke, America's cyber-security tsar, unveiled his long-awaited blueprint for securing critical infrastructure from digital attacks. It was a bit of a damp squib, making no firm recommendations and proposing no new regulation or legislation. But its lily-livered approach might, in fact, be the right one. When a risk has been overstated, inaction may be the best policy.
    It is difficult to avoid comparisons with the "millennium bug" and the predictions of widespread computer chaos arising from the change of date to the year 2000. Then, as now, the alarm was sounded by technology vendors and consultants, who stood to gain from scare-mongering. But Ross Anderson, a computer scientist at Cambridge University, prefers to draw an analogy with the environmental lobby.



    36.
    	
    We learn from the first paragraph that ____________.
    A) terrorists could plunge a large American city into chaos through electronic attack  
    B) American people have no experience in dealing with terrorists  
    C) the computer systems of utility companies are rather vulnerable  
    D) the response of emergency services is far from satisfactory  

    正确答案： A
    37.
    	
    Speaking of the doom-mongers, the author implies that_____________.
    A) their worries are quite reasonable  
    B) their warnings should be taken seriously  
    C) they exaggerate the threat utility companies are facing  
    D) they are familiar with the way terrorists strike  

    正确答案： C
    38.
    	
    In the view of Gartner consultant, ___________.
    A) terrorists may launch another “Pearl Harbor” attack  
    B) terrorists have ample capital and time to prepare a stunning strike  
    C) it is very costly and time-consuming to attack critical infrastructure  
    D) it is unlikely that terrorists would resort to electronic means to attack critical infrastructure  

    正确答案： D
    39.

    正确答案： C
    40.

    B) doom-mongers care more about their own interests than national security  
    C) computer scientists have better judgment than doom-mongers
