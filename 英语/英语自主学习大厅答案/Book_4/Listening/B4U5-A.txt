    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         This is turning out to be a month for seeing old friends. I got an email a couple of weeks ago from an old friend from graduate school. She and her family are visiting L.A. for a week. They plan to see family and to visit old friends. Since she moved out of the country, I hadn’t seen her in ages. I’m looking forward to meeting her new kids and seeing her again.
            Another old friend called this week. She and I were good friends in our undergraduate days. She plans to drop by L.A. on her way to San Francisco. We’ve made plans to have lunch. She works in Washington D.C. as a political advisor and is usually very busy. I’m glad she could make time for us to get together.
            When we say good-bye to our friends, we always hope to keep in touch. But, what with this and that, it’s sometimes hard to do. With friends that I’ve fallen out of touch with, it’s sometimes hard to meet up again and pick up where we left off. We’ve both moved on to a different phase in our lives. Some of my old friends have become very successful, living exciting and rich lives. Other friends are struggling along and are just making ends meet. But, no matter how they’re doing, it’s always nice to make contact with old friends again.
            I’m really looking forward to seeing these old pals of mine and catching up after all this time.

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         A bunch of my old college friends came into town for a few days and we went out last night bar hopping until closing time. We started around 9 pm and were on our third bar when we closed it down. Some of us were starving and the rest of us were slightly hungry so we decided to get a late-night snack. We didn’t want fast food so we decided to try to find a 24-hour diner.
            We passed on a chain restaurant and went instead to a bar near downtown. The six of us went in and we sat at the counter. Since the place was dead, we had it to ourselves. One of my friends, Paul, got pretty noisy and the waitress had to tell him to chill out. He was pretty hammered so we had to keep an eye on him. He didn’t usually drink much, but he was depressed about a fight he had had with his girlfriend and decided to get drunk. I felt sorry for the guy, especially since I knew that he would have a terrible feeling in the morning. I tried to get him to drink some coffee, but he just wanted to stay drunk.
            After we left the diner, I dropped everybody off at Paul ??s, since I was the chosen driver. They were all crashing at his place. I made my way home and fell into bed. It was good to see my old friends. But I’m definitely getting too old to party like we did in college. As the old saying goes: The mind is willing, but the body is weak.

    Script:         When I got home from work, I opened my mail. The letter turned out to be a surprise. I held in my hand an invitation to my 10-year high school reunion. It was a shock because I couldn’t believe it had been 10 years. The first thing I did was to call my oldest and dearest friend, Maria. We had gone to high school together and we had been best friends.
            Maria said that she had received her invitation in the mail, too. I told her that I was leaning against going. After all, why live in the past? I thought. But, Maria convinced me that it would be a trip to see some of our old friends and to find out what had become of them. At the very least, we would get a chance to see each other and to talk about old times.
            And, Maria said, Jeff McQuillan might be there. Ah, Jeff McQuillan. He was a senior when I was a sophomore, and I had a big crush on him. I thought he was so cute and he was smart, too. He was at the top of his class. He wasn’t the class clown, but he had a great sense of humor and was voted most likely to succeed. He never gave me a second look, but I always made sure I sat next to him in class. I wonder what he’s doing now and whether he’ll be there. Hmm, maybe this reunion will be more fun than I thought.

    Part II    Oral Tasks  ( 2 minutes ) 



    Section A 

    Interpret the following Chinese passage into English. You can either interpret it sentence by sentence or give out the main points in your own words. You will have two minutes for preparation and three minutes for interpretation.
    31.	尽管人类肤色不同、语言不同、种族不同，但我们共同分享奥林匹克的魅力与欢乐，共同追求着人类和平的理想。我们同属一个世界，我们拥有同样的希望和梦想。

    思考/准备


    Section B 

    Read the following description of Facebook. What do you think about the online friendship or relationship? Is it possible that in the future friends are only seen on the screen of computers but not in life? Give your comments and idea on this phenomenon. You will have two minutes for preparation and three minutes for presentation.
    32.	Facebook, the world's largest social network connecting people online, provides additional evidence in support of Dunbar's Number. Dunbar himself found that the average number of friends people have on Facebook is 120 to 130, which is about right when you consider that some in our social network (babies, for example) may not yet be on Facebook (we hope!). Of course, there are people who have 5,000 "friends", but these are not actually people they have any real friendship or emotional closeness to.
