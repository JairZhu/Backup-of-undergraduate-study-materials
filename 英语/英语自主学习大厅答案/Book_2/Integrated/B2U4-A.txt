    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            In the 1950s, the pioneers of artificial intelligence (AI) predicted that, by the end of this century, computers would be conversing with us at work and robots would be performing our housework. But as useful as computers are, they're nowhere close to achieving anything remotely resembling these early aspirations for humanlike behavior. Never mind something as complex as conversation: the most powerful computers struggle to reliably recognize the shape of an object, the most elementary of tasks for a ten-month-old kid.
            The problem, the scientists say, is that AI has been trying to separate the highest, most abstract levels of thought, like language and mathematics, and to duplicate them with logical, step-by-step programs. A new movement in AI, on the other hand, takes a closer look at the more roundabout way in which nature came up with intelligence. Many of these researchers study evolution and natural adaptation instead of formal logic and conventional computer programs. The results of these early efforts are as promising as they are peculiar, and the new nature-based AI movement is slowly but surely moving to the forefront of the field.
            Imitating the brain's neural network is a huge step in the right direction, says computer scientist and biophysicist Michael Conrad, but it still misses an important aspect of natural intelligence. "People tend to treat the brain as if it were made up of color-coded transistors," he explains. "But it's not simply a clever network of switches. There are lots of important things going on inside the brain cells themselves."
            Right now, the notion that conventional computers and software are fundamentally incapable of matching the processes that take place in the brain remains controversial. But if it proves true, then the efforts of Conrad and his fellow AI rebels could turn out to be the only game in town.



    31.
    	
    The author says that the powerful computers of today ____ .
    A) are capable of reliably recognizing the shape of an object  
    B) are close to exhibiting humanlike behavior  
    C) are not very different in their performance from those of the 1950's  
    D) still cannot communicate with people in a human language  

    正确答案： D
    32.
    	
    The new trend in artificial intelligence research stems from _____ . 
    A) the shift of the focus of study on the recognition of the shapes of objects  
    B) the belief that human intelligence cannot be duplicated with logical, step-by-step programs  
    C) the aspirations of scientists to duplicate the intelligence of a ten-month-old child  
    D) the efforts made by scientists in the study of the similarities between transistors and brain cells  

    正确答案： B
    33.
    	
    Conrad and his group of AI researchers have been making enormous efforts to_____ . 
    A) find a roundabout way to design powerful computers  
    B) build a computer using a clever network of switches  
    C) find out how intelligence develops in nature  
    D) separate the highest and most abstract levels of thought  

    正确答案： C
    34.
    	
    What's the author's opinion about the new AI movement?
    A) It has created a sensation among artificial intelligence researchers.  
    B) It's a breakthrough in duplicating human thought processes.  
    C) It's more like a peculiar game rather than a real scientific effort.  
    D) It may prove to be in the right direction though nobody is sure of its future prospects.  

    正确答案： D
    35.
    	
    Which of the following is closest in meaning to the phrase “the only game in town” (in Para.4)?
    A) The only approach to building an artificially intelligent computer.  
    B) The only way for them to win a prize in artificial intelligence research.  
    C) The only area worth studying in computer science.  
    D) The only game they would like to play in town.  

    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            It happened one morning 20 years ago. British scientist Alec Jeffrey stumbled upon DNA fingerprinting: He identified the patterns of genetic material that are unique to almost every individual. His discovery changed everything from the way we do criminal investigations to the way we decide family law.
            The patterns within DNA are unique to each individual, except identical twins, who share the same pattern. The ability to identify these patterns has been used to convict murderers and to clear people who are wrongly accused. It is also used to identify the victims of war and settle disputes over who is the father of a child.
            Jeffrey said he and his colleagues made the discovery by accident while tracking genetic variations. But, within six months of the discovery, genetic fingerprinting had been used in an immigration case, to prove that an African boy really was his parents' son. In 1986, it was used for the first time in a British criminal case: It cleared one suspect after being accused of two rapes and murders and helped convict another man.
            DNA testing is now very common. In Britain, a national criminal database established in 1995 now contains 2.5 million DNA samples. The U.S. and Canada are developing similar systems. But there are fears about the stored DNA samples and how they could be used to harm a person’s privacy. That includes a person's medical history, racial origin or psychological profile.
            DNA testing is not an unfailing proof of identity. Till, it is considered a reasonably reliable system for determining the things it is used for. Jeffrey estimates the probability of two individuals' DNA profiles matching in the most commonly used tests at between one in a billion or one in a trillion.



    36.
    	
    The passage is mainly about___________.
    A) the discovery of DNA fingerprinting by Jeffery  
    B) the practice of DNA fingerprinting in court  
    C) the DNA fingerprinting in the present situation  
    D) the merits and demerits of DNA fingerprinting

    D) inventing in experiments
