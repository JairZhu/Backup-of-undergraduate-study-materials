    Section B 

    Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.


            The rat race is often thought of as being (11)_________________ with the corporate environment where the company tries to (12)_________________ the most productivity out of its workers.
            With a (13)_________________ like that, it is no (14)_________________ that many people in our frenetic (忙乱的) modern life begin to question our (15)_________________ about work and begin seeking better (16)_________________ to escape the rat race. Can one make a living if one is to leave the rat race? How?
            One way is to become (17)_________________ and work for oneself ― such as a freelance (自由职业的) writer, web designer, consultant, etc. Another is to switch to a less demanding job, to a job where one is (18)_________________ , or to a job that requires less hours.
            Many tried and left the rat race. Some succeed and make more than before. Some end up making less, but happier. Some failed and have to return back to the rat race.

However, this does not give an accurate percentage of those who succeeded versus (20)_________________ . It is typically those who made it that are the ones in the news and media.

    Script:         The rat race is often thought of as being associated with the corporate environment where the company tries to squeeze the most productivity out of its workers.
            With a definition like that, it is no wonder that many people in our frenetic (忙乱的) modern life begin to question our attitudes about work and begin seeking better alternatives to escape the rat race. Can one make a living if one is to leave the rat race? How?
            One way is to become self-employed and work for oneself ― such as a freelance (自由职业的) writer, web designer, consultant, etc. Another is to switch to a less demanding job, to a job where one is following one’s passion, or to a job that requires less hours.
            Many tried and left the rat race. Some succeed and make more than before. Some end up making less, but happier. Some failed and have to return back to the rat race.

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage.

But his dead mother’s challenge echoes in his soul. So, too, do the voices of those who believed him stupid, incapable of living   26    . All his life he’s struggled to prove them wrong.

Sixty-three years old. And his enemies ― a   28    body that betrays him and a changing world that no longer needs him ― are gaining on him.
            With   29    hands he assembles his weapons: dark slacks, blue shirt and matching jacket, brown tie, tan raincoat and hat. Image, he believes, is everything.
            He stops in the entryway, picks up his briefcase and steps outside. A fall wind has   30    . The weatherman was right. He pulls his raincoat tighter.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            A new era is coming with a fundamental change in the way of work, in our industrialized world. Call it what you will: the service economy, the information age, the knowledge society. It all translates to a fundamental change in the way we work. Already we’re partly there. The percentage of people who earn their living by making things has fallen dramatically in the Western World. Today the majority of jobs in America, Europe and Japan (two thirds or more in many of these countries) are in the service industry, and the number is on the rise. More women are in the work force than ever before. There are more and more part-time jobs, and a growing number of people who are self-employed. But the breadth of the economic transformation can’t be measured by numbers alone, because it also is giving rise to a radical new way of thinking about the nature of work itself. Long-held notions about jobs and careers, the skills needed to succeed, even the relation between individuals and employers ― all these are being challenged.
            We have only to look behind us to get some sense of what may lie ahead. No one looking ahead 20 years possibly could have foreseen the ways in which a single invention, the chip (集成块), would transform our world thanks to its applications in personal computers, digital communications and factory robots. Tomorrow’s achievements in biotechnology, artificial intelligence or even some still unimagined technology could produce a similar wave of dramatic changes like the invention of the microchip. But one thing is certain: information and knowledge will become even more vital, and people who possess it, whether they work in manufacturing or services, will have the advantage and produce the wealth. Computer knowledge will become as basic a requirement as the ability to read and write.
            So the whole world will be computerized and some people will adapt, others won’t. But hopefully not all work will be equal. Some people argued, that people no longer should be classified as white or blue collar, manager or laborer, but rather as knowledge and service workers. The ability to solve problems by applying information instead of performing routine tasks will be valued above all else. But there will be a future in manufacturing, and the reason for that, is the move away from standardized production and toward more flexible, customized manufacturing. To survive, the workers have to think of new ways to meet the changing demands of customers.

    31.
    	
    A characteristic of the information age is that ________.
    A) the service industry is relying more and more on the female work force  
    B) manufacturing industries are steadily increasing  
    C) people find it harder and harder to earn a living by working in factories  
    D) most of the job opportunities can now be found in the service industry  

    正确答案： D
    32.
    	
    One of the great changes brought about by the knowledge society is that ________.
    A) the difference between the employee and the employer has become insignificant  
    B) people’s traditional concepts about work no longer hold true  
    C) most people have to take part-time jobs  
    D) people have to change their jobs from time to time  

    正确答案： B
    33.
    	
    By referring to computers and other inventions, the author means to say that ________.
    A) people should be able to respond quickly to the advancement of technology  
    B) future achievements in technology will bring about inconceivable dramatic changes  
    C) the importance of high technology has been overlooked  
    D) computer science will play a leading role in the future information services  

    正确答案： B
    34.
    	
    The future will probably belong to those who ________.
    A) possess and know how to make use of information  
    B) give full play to their brain potential  
    C) involve themselves in service industries  
    D) cast their minds ahead instead of looking back  

    正确答案： A
    35.
    	
    Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?
    A) Computers and the Knowledge Society  
    B) Service Industries in Modern Society  
    C) Features and Implications of the New Era  
    D) Rapid Advancement of Information Technology  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            Imagine eating everything delicious you want ― with none of the fat. That would be great, wouldn’t it?
            New “fake fat” products appeared on store shelves in the United States recently, but not everyone is happy about it. Makers of the products, which contain a compound called olestra (人造脂肪), say food manufacturers can now eliminate fat from certain foods. Critics, however, say the new compound can rob the body of essential vitamins and nutrients (营养物) and can also cause unpleasant side effects in some people. So it’s up to consumers to decide whether the new fat-free products taste good enough to keep eating.
            Chemists discovered olestra in the late 1960s, when they were searching for a fat that could be digested by infants more easily. Instead of finding the desired fat, the researchers created a fat that can’t be digested at all.
            Normally, special chemicals in the intestines (肠) "grab" molecules of regular fat and break them down so they can be used by the body. A molecule of regular fat is made up of three molecules of substances called fatty acids.
            The fatty acids are absorbed by the intestines and bring with them the essential vitamins A, D, E, and K. When fat molecules are present in the intestines with any of those vitamins, the vitamins attach to the molecules and are carried into the bloodstream.
            Olestra, which is made from six to eight molecules of fatty acids, is too large for the intestines to absorb. It just slides through the intestines without being broken down. Manufacturers say it’s that ability to slide unchanged through the intestines that makes olestra so valuable as a fat substitute. It provides consumers with the taste of regular fat without any bad effects on the body. But critics say olestra can prevent vitamins A, D, E, and K from being absorbed. It can also prevent the absorption of carotenoids (类胡萝卜素), compounds that may reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease, etc.
            Manufacturers are adding vitamins A, D, E, and K as well as carotenoids to their products now. Even so, some nutritionists are still concerned that people might eat unlimited amounts of food made with the fat substitute without worrying about how many calories they are consuming.

    36.
    	
    We learn from the passage that olestra is a substance that ______________.
    A) contains plenty of nutrients  
    B) renders foods calorie-free while retaining their vitamins  
    C) makes foods easily digestible  
    D) makes foods fat-free while keeping them delicious  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    The result of the search for an easily digestible fat turned out to be ______________.
    A) commercially useless  
    B) just as anticipated  
    C) somewhat controversial  
    D) quite unexpected  

    正确答案： D
    38.
    	
    Olestra is different from ordinary fats in that ______________.
    A) it passes through the intestines without being absorbed  
    B) it facilitates the absorption of vitamins by the body  
    C) it helps reduce the incidence of heart disease  
    D) it prevents excessive intake of vitamins  

    正确答案： A
    39.
    	
    What is a possible negative effect of olestra according to some critics? 
    A) It may impair the digestive system.  
    B) It may affect the overall fat intake.  
    C) It may increase the risk of cancer.  
    D) It may spoil the consumers’ appetite.  

    正确答案： C
    40.
    	
    Why are nutritionists concerned about adding vitamins to olestra? 
    A) It may lead to the over-consumption of vitamins.  
    B) People may be induced to eat more than what is necessary.  
    C) The function of the intestines may be weakened.  
    D) It may trigger a new wave of fake food production.
