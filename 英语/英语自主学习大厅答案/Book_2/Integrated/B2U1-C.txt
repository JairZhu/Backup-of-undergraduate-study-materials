    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Let us suppose that you are in the position of a parent. Would you allow your children to read any book they wanted to without first checking its contents? Would you take your children to see any film without first finding out whether it is suitable for them? If your answer to these questions is "yes", then you are extremely permissive. If your answer is "no", then you are exercising your right as a parent to protect your children from what you consider to be undesirable influences. In other words, by acting as a censor yourself, you are admitting that there is a strong case for censorship.
            Now, of course, you will say that it is one thing to exercise censorship where children are concerned and quite another to do the same for adults. Children need protection and it is the parents' responsibility to provide it. But what about adults? Aren't they old enough to decide what is good for them? The answer is that many adults are, but don't make the mistake of thinking that all adults are like you. Censorship is for the good of society as a whole. Like the law, censorship contributes to the common good.
            Some people think that it is disgraceful that a censor should interfere with the works of art. Who is this person, they say, to ban this great book or cut that great film? No one can set himself up as a superior being. But we must remember two things. Firstly, where genuine works of art are concerned, modern censors are extremely liberal in their views D often far more liberal than a large section of the public. Artistic merit is something which censors clearly recognize. And secondly, we must bear in mind that the great proportion of books, plays and films which come before the censor are very far from being "works of arts".
            When discussing censorship, we should not confine our attention to great masterpieces, but should consider the vast numbers of publications and films which make up the bulk of the entertainment industry. When censorship laws are relaxed, immoral people are given a license to produce virtually anything in the name of "art". There is an increasing tendency to equate artistic with "pornographic" (色情的). The vast market for pornography would rapidly be exploited. One of the great things that censorship does is to prevent certain people from making fat profits by corrupting the minds of others. To argue in favor of absolute freedom is to argue in favor of anarchy.
            Society would really be poorer if it deprived itself of the wise counsel and the restraining influence which a censor provides.

    A) let their children read any books they like to  
    B) not let their children see any films they like to

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Insurance is the sharing of risks. Nearly everyone is exposed to risk of some sort. The house owner, for example, knows that his property can be damaged by fire; the ship-owner knows that his vessel may be lost at sea; the breadwinner knows that he may die at an early age and leave his family poorer. On the other hand, not every house is damaged by fire or every vessel lost at sea. If these persons each put a small sum into a pool, there will be enough to meet the needs of the few who do suffer loss. In other words, the losses of the few are met from the contributions of the many. This is the basis of insurance. Those who pay the contribution are known as insured and those who administer the pool of contributions as insurers.
            The legal basis of all insurance is the policy. This is a printed form of contract on stout paper of the best quality. It states that in return for the regular payment by the insured of a named sum of money, called the premium(保险费)which is usually paid every year, the insurer will pay a sum of money or compensation for loss, if the risk or event insured against actually happens. The premium for an insurance naturally depends upon how likely the risk is to happen, as suggested by past experience. If companies fix their premiums too high, there will be more competition in their branch of insurance and they may lose business. On the other hand, if they make the premium too low, they will lose money and may even have to drop out of business. So the ordinary forces of supply and demand keep premiums at a level satisfactory to both the insurer and the insured.



    36.
    	
    According to the passage, insurance is possible because ______.
    A) only a small proportion of the insured suffer loss  
    B) only insured people suffer loss  
    C) nearly everyone suffers loss  
    D) everyone at some time suffers loss  

    正确答案： A

    A) the cost of administering insurance  
    B) the amount of each premium  
    C) money paid by the insurers  
    D) money paid by the insured  

    正确答案： D
    38.
    	
    A policy is _____.
    A) a legal agreement  
    B) a check to be cashed at the bank  
    C) money paid by the insured  
    D) a particular kind of insurance

    D) insurance companies compete with each other
