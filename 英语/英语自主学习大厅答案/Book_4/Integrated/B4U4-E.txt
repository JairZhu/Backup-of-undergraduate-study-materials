    Script:         This current wave of globalization has been driven by policies that have opened economies domestically and internationally. In the years since the Second World War, and especially during the past two decades, many governments have adopted free-market economic systems, vastly increasing their own productive potential and creating myriad new opportunities for international trade and investment. Governments also have negotiated dramatic reductions in barriers to commerce and have established international agreements to promote trade in goods, services, and investment. Taking advantage of new opportunities in foreign markets, corporations have built foreign factories and established production and marketing arrangements with foreign partners. Globalization is deeply controversial, however. Proponents of globalization argue that it allows poor countries and their citizens to develop economically and raise their standards of living, while opponents of globalization claim that the creation of an unfettered international free market has benefited multinational corporations in the Western world at the expense of local enterprises, local cultures, and common people. Resistance to globalization has therefore taken shape both at a popular and at a governmental level as people and governments try to manage the flow of capital, labor, goods, and ideas that constitute the current wave of globalization. To find the right balance between benefits and costs associated with globalization, citizens of all nations need to understand how globalization works and the policy choices facing them and their societies.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            A strange thing about humans is their capacity for blind rage. Rage is presumably an emotion resulting from survival instinct, but the surprising thing about it is that we do not deploy it against other animals. If we encounter a dangerous wild animal D a poisonous snake or a wild cat D we do not fly into a temper. If we are unarmed, we show fear and attempt to back away; if we are suitably armed, we attack, but in a rational manner not in a rage. We reserve rage for our own species. It is hard to see any survival value in attacking one’s own, but if we take account of the long competition, which must have existed between our own subspecies and others like Neanderthal man D indeed others still more remote from us than Neanderthal man D human rage becomes more comprehensible.
            In our everyday language and behavior there are many reminders of those early struggles. We are always using the words “us and them”. “Our” side is perpetually trying to do down the “other” side. In games we artificially create other subspecies we can attack. The opposition of “us” and “them” is the touchstone of the two-party system of “democratic” politics. Although there are no very serious consequences to many of these modern psychological representations of the “us and them” emotion, it is as well to remember that the original aim was not to beat the other subspecies in a game but to exterminate it.
            The readiness with which humans allow themselves to be regimented has permitted large armies to be formed, which, taken together with the “us and them” blind rage, has led to destructive clashes within our subspecies itself. The First World War is an example in which Europe divided itself into two imaginary subspecies. And there is a similar extermination battle now in Northern Ireland. The idea that there is a religious basis for this clash is illusory, for not even the Pope has been able to control it. The clash is much more primitive than the Christian religion, much older in its emotional origin. The conflict in Ireland is unlikely to stop until a greater primitive fear is imposed from outside the community, or until the combatants become exhausted.



    31.
    	
    A suitable title for this passage would be____.
    A) Why Human Armies Are Formed  
    B) Man’s Anger Against Rage  
    C) The Human Capacity for Rage  
    D) Early Struggles of Angry Man  

    正确答案： C
    32.
    	
    According to the author, the surprising aspect of human anger is ____.
    A) its lengthy and complex development  
    B) a conflict such as is now going on in Northern Ireland  
    C) that we do not fly into a temper more often  
    D) that we reserve anger for mankind  

    正确答案： D
    33.
    	
    The passage suggests that____.
    A) historically, we have created an “us” versus “them” society  
    B) humans have had a natural disinclination toward formal grouping  
    C) the First World War is an example of how man has always avoided domination  
    D) the emotional origin of the war in Ireland is lost in time  

    正确答案： A
    34.
    	
    From the passage we can infer that ____.
    A) the artificial creation of a subspecies unlike us is something that never happens  
    B) games are psychologically unhealthy  
    C) any artificially created subspecies would be our enemy  
    D) the real or imagined existence of an opposing subspecies is inherent in man’s activities  

    正确答案： D
    35.
    	
    The author believes that a religious explanation for the war in Northern Ireland is____.
    A) founded in historical fact  
    B) deceptive  
    C) apparent  
    D) probably accurate  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            The most effective attacks against globalization are usually not those related to economics. Instead, they are social, ethical and, above all, cultural. These arguments surfaced amid the protests in Seattle in 1999 and more recently in Davos, Bangkok and Prague. They say this: the disappearance of national borders and the establishment of a world interconnected by markets will deal a death blow to regional and national cultures, and to the traditions, customs, myths and mores that determine each country’s or region’s cultural identity. Since most of the world is incapable of resisting the invasion of cultural products from developed countries that inevitably trails the great transnational corporations, North American culture will ultimately impose itself, standardizing the world and annihilating its richness of diverse cultures. In this manner, all other peoples, and not just the small and weak ones, will lose their identity, their soul, and will become no more than 21st-century colonies modeled after the cultural norms of a new imperialism that, in addition to ruling over the planet with its capital, military might and scientific knowledge, will impose on others its language and its ways of thinking, believing, enjoying and dreaming.
            Even though I believe this cultural argument against globalization is unacceptable, we should recognize that deep within it lies an unquestionable truth. This century, the world in which we will live will be less picturesque and filled with less local color than the one we left behind. The festivals, attire (穿着), customs, ceremonies, rites and beliefs that in the past gave humanity its culturally and racially variety are progressively disappearing or confining themselves to minority sectors, while the bulk of society abandons them and adopts others more suited to the reality of our time.
            All countries of the earth experience this process, some more quickly than others, but it is not due to globalization. Rather, it is due to modernization, of which the former is effect, not cause. This process is unavoidable. In theory, perhaps, a country could keep this identity, but only if D like certain remote tribes in Africa or the Amazon D it decides to live in total isolation, cutting off all exchange with other nations and practicing self-sufficiency. A cultural identity preserved in this form would take that society back to prehistoric standards of living.
            It is true that modernization makes many forms of traditional life disappear. But at the same time, it opens opportunities and constitutes an important step forward for a society as a whole.



    36.
    	
    Which of the following is the argument against globalization?
    A) The world will become a globalized economic entity.  
    B) Cultural identities in some countries will be compromised.  
    C) Transnational corporations will take advantage of the poor countries.  
    D) Poor countries will be dominated by the powerful ones.  

    正确答案： B

    B) countries should strive to reserve their unique customs and practices
