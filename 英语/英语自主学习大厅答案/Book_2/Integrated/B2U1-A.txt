    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Let us suppose that you are in the position of a parent. Would you allow your children to read any book they wanted to without first checking its contents? Would you take your children to see any film without first finding out whether it is suitable for them? If your answer to these questions is "yes", then you are extremely permissive. If your answer is "no", then you are exercising your right as a parent to protect your children from what you consider to be undesirable influences. In other words, by acting as a censor yourself, you are admitting that there is a strong case for censorship.
            Now, of course, you will say that it is one thing to exercise censorship where children are concerned and quite another to do the same for adults. Children need protection and it is the parents' responsibility to provide it. But what about adults? Aren't they old enough to decide what is good for them? The answer is that many adults are, but don't make the mistake of thinking that all adults are like you. Censorship is for the good of society as a whole. Like the law, censorship contributes to the common good.
            Some people think that it is disgraceful that a censor should interfere with the works of art. Who is this person, they say, to ban this great book or cut that great film? No one can set himself up as a superior being. But we must remember two things. Firstly, where genuine works of art are concerned, modern censors are extremely liberal in their views D often far more liberal than a large section of the public. Artistic merit is something which censors clearly recognize. And secondly, we must bear in mind that the great proportion of books, plays and films which come before the censor are very far from being "works of arts".
            When discussing censorship, we should not confine our attention to great masterpieces, but should consider the vast numbers of publications and films which make up the bulk of the entertainment industry. When censorship laws are relaxed, immoral people are given a license to produce virtually anything in the name of "art". There is an increasing tendency to equate artistic with "pornographic" (色情的). The vast market for pornography would rapidly be exploited. One of the great things that censorship does is to prevent certain people from making fat profits by corrupting the minds of others. To argue in favor of absolute freedom is to argue in favor of anarchy.
            Society would really be poorer if it deprived itself of the wise counsel and the restraining influence which a censor provides.



    31.
    	
    Permissive parents would ________.
    A) let their children read any books they like to  
    B) not let their children see any films they like to  
    C) not let their children read any books without first checking their contents  
    D) let their children see the films with their first checking

    33.

    A) Some adults can't tell right from wrong.

    D) Censorship is necessary because many books, plays and films are far from being "works of art".  
    
    正确答案： C
    34.

    A) Permissive Parents and Responsible Parents  
    B) Censorship and the Law  
    C) Censors Value Artistic Merits  
    D) Censorship Performs Good Service to Society  
    
    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Personality is to a large extent inherent. A-type parents usually bring A-type offspring. But the environment must also have a profound effect if competition is important to the parents. It is likely to become a major factor in the lives of their children.
            One place where children soak up A characteristics is school, which is, by its very nature, a highly competitive institution. Too many schools adopt the "win at all costs" moral standard and measure their success by sporting achievements. The current passion for making children compete with their classmates or against their classmates or against the clock produces a two-layer system, in which competitive A-types seem in some way better than their B-type fellows. Being too keen to win can have dangerous consequences: remember that Pheidippides, the first marathon (马拉松) runner, dropped dead seconds after saying: "Rejoice, we conquer!"
            By far the worst form of competition in schools is the disproportionate emphasis on examinations. It is a rare school that allows pupils to concentrate on those things they do well. The merits of competition by examination are somewhat questionable, but competition in the certain knowledge of failure is positively harmful.
            Obviously, it is neither practical nor desirable that all A youngsters change into B's. The world needs A types, and schools have an important duty to try to fit a child's personality to his possible future employment. It is top management.
            If the preoccupation of schools with academic work was lessened, more time might be spent teaching children surer values. Perhaps selection for the caring professions, especially medicine, could be made less by good grades in chemistry and more by such considerations as sensitivity and sympathy. It is surly a mistake to choose our doctors exclusively from A-type stock. B's are important and should be encouraged.



    36.
    	
    In Para.2, the word "institution" refers to _________.
    A) establishment
