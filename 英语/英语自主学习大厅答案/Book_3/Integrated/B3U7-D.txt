    Section B 

    Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.


            The rat race is often thought of as being (11)_________________ with the corporate environment where the company tries to (12)_________________ the most productivity out of its workers.
            With a (13)_________________ like that, it is no (14)_________________ that many people in our frenetic (忙乱的) modern life begin to question our (15)_________________ about work and begin seeking better (16)_________________ to escape the rat race.

    Script:         The rat race is often thought of as being associated with the corporate environment where the company tries to squeeze the most productivity out of its workers.
            With a definition like that, it is no wonder that many people in our frenetic (忙乱的) modern life begin to question our attitudes about work and begin seeking better alternatives to escape the rat race. Can one make a living if one is to leave the rat race? How?
            One way is to become self-employed and work for oneself ― such as a freelance (自由职业的) writer, web designer, consultant, etc. Another is to switch to a less demanding job, to a job where one is following one’s passion, or to a job that requires less hours.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            When global warming finally came, it stuck with a vengeance. In some regions, temperatures rose several degrees in less than a century. Sea levels shot up nearly 400 feet, flooding coastal settlements and forcing people to migrate inland. Deserts spread throughout the world as vegetation shifted drastically in North America, Europe and Asia. After driving many of the animals around them to near extinction, people were forced to abandon their old way of life for a radically new survival strategy that resulted in widespread starvation and disease. The adaptation was farming: the global-warming crisis that gave rise to it happened more than 10,000 years ago.
            As environmentalists convene in Rio de Janeiro this week to ponder the global climate of the future, earth scientists are in the midst of a revolution in understanding how climate has changed in the past ― and how those changes have transformed human existence. Researchers have begun to piece together an illuminating picture of the powerful geological and astronomical forces that have combined to change the planet’s environment from hot to cold, wet to dry and back again over a time period stretching back hundreds of millions of year.
            Most importantly, scientists are beginning to realize that the climatic changes have had a major impact on the evolution of the human species. New research now suggests that climate shifts have played a key role in nearly every significant turning point in human evolution: from the dawn of primates (灵长目动物) some 65 million years ago to human ancestors rising up to walk on two legs, from the huge expansion of the human brain to the rise of agriculture. Indeed, the human history has not been merely touched by global climate change, some scientists argue, it has in some instances been driven by it.
            The new research has profound implications for the environmental summit in Rio. Among other things, the findings demonstrate that dramatic climate change is nothing new for planet Earth. The benign (宜人的) global environment that has existed over the past 10,000 years ― during which agriculture, writing, cities and most other features of civilization appeared ― is a mere bright spot in a much larger pattern of widely varying climate over the ages. In fact, the pattern or climate change in the past reveals that Earth’s climate will almost certainly go through dramatic changes in the future ― even without the influence of human activity.

    A) has seldom been accompanied by climatic changes  
    B) has exerted little influence on climatic changes  
    C) has largely been affected by climatic changes

    A) human activities have accelerated changes of Earth’s environment  
    B) Earth’s environment will remain mild despite human interference  
    C) Earth’s climate is bound to change significantly in the future  
    D) Earth’s climate is unlikely to undergo substantial changes in the future  

    正确答案： C
    35.
    	
    The message the author wishes to convey in the passage is that _______________.
    A) human civilization remains glorious though it is affected by climatic changes  
    B) mankind is virtually helpless in the face of the dramatic changes of climate  
    C) man has to limit his activities to slow down the global warming process  
    D) human civilization will continue to develop in spite of the changes of nature  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            Imagine eating everything delicious you want ― with none of the fat. That would be great, wouldn’t it?
            New “fake fat” products appeared on store shelves in the United States recently, but not everyone is happy about it. Makers of the products, which contain a compound called olestra (人造脂肪), say food manufacturers can now eliminate fat from certain foods. Critics, however, say the new compound can rob the body of essential vitamins and nutrients (营养物) and can also cause unpleasant side effects in some people. So it’s up to consumers to decide whether the new fat-free products taste good enough to keep eating.
            Chemists discovered olestra in the late 1960s, when they were searching for a fat that could be digested by infants more easily. Instead of finding the desired fat, the researchers created a fat that can’t be digested at all.
            Normally, special chemicals in the intestines (肠) "grab" molecules of regular fat and break them down so they can be used by the body. A molecule of regular fat is made up of three molecules of substances called fatty acids.
            The fatty acids are absorbed by the intestines and bring with them the essential vitamins A, D, E, and K. When fat molecules are present in the intestines with any of those vitamins, the vitamins attach to the molecules and are carried into the bloodstream.
            Olestra, which is made from six to eight molecules of fatty acids, is too large for the intestines to absorb. It just slides through the intestines without being broken down. Manufacturers say it’s that ability to slide unchanged through the intestines that makes olestra so valuable as a fat substitute. It provides consumers with the taste of regular fat without any bad effects on the body. But critics say olestra can prevent vitamins A, D, E, and K from being absorbed. It can also prevent the absorption of carotenoids (类胡萝卜素), compounds that may reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease, etc.
            Manufacturers are adding vitamins A, D, E, and K as well as carotenoids to their products now. Even so, some nutritionists are still concerned that people might eat unlimited amounts of food made with the fat substitute without worrying about how many calories they are consuming.

    36.
    	
    We learn from the passage that olestra is a substance that ______________.
    A) contains plenty of nutrients  
    B) renders foods calorie-free while retaining their vitamins  
    C) makes foods easily digestible  
    D) makes foods fat-free while keeping them delicious  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    The result of the search for an easily digestible fat turned out to be ______________.
    A) commercially useless  
    B) just as anticipated  
    C) somewhat controversial  
    D) quite unexpected  

    正确答案： D
    38.
    	
    Olestra is different from ordinary fats in that ______________.
    A) it passes through the intestines without being absorbed  
    B) it facilitates the absorption of vitamins by the body  
    C) it helps reduce the incidence of heart disease  
    D) it prevents excessive intake of vitamins  

    正确答案： A
    39.
    	
    What is a possible negative effect of olestra according to some critics? 
    A) It may impair the digestive system.  
    B) It may affect the overall fat intake.  
    C) It may increase the risk of cancer.  
    D) It may spoil the consumers’ appetite.  

    正确答案： C
    40.
    	
    Why are nutritionists concerned about adding vitamins to olestra? 
    A) It may lead to the over-consumption of vitamins.  
    B) People may be induced to eat more than what is necessary.  
    C) The function of the intestines may be weakened.  
    D) It may trigger a new wave of fake food production.  

    正确答案： B
