    Script:         The steam train represents the industrial revolution, and the scene of them in Jiayang of southwest China's Sichuan Province may cure nostalgia for people reminiscing about the good old days. Every day, sounds of rhythmic “ding-dang” “ding-dang” are heard from the steep mountains in Jianwei County of Sichuan’s Leshan City. An old-fashioned steam train staggers its carriages along Mt. Leshan on a narrow trail, blissfully indicating its presence to the outside world.
            Until now, the small old steam train is still the only means of transportation connecting the old mining area with the outside world, and it is the only steam train carrying passengers running on such a narrow trail. Built alongside the mountain, the railway features a narrower trail, with more turns and steeper gradients than the modern railway.
            Set aside all the characteristics, even the train station can carry you back into the 18th century. You will see an all-manual controlled old-fashioned train D shoveling coal by hand, handbrakes, and hand set telephone. Flag sign and whistles are the only command for guiding passengers to get on and off the train.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            The past ages of man have all been carefully labeled by anthropologists. When the time comes for anthropologists to turn their attention to the twentieth century, they will surely choose the label “Legless Man”.
            Histories of the time will go something like this: “in the twentieth century, people forgot how to use their legs. Men and women moved about in cars, buses and trains from a very early age. There were lifts and escalators in all large buildings to prevent people from walking. The surprising thing is that they didn’t use their legs even when they went on holiday. They built cable railways, ski-lifts and roads to the top of every huge mountain. All the beauty spots on earth were marred by the presence of large car parks.”
            The future history books might also record that we were deprived of the use of our eyes. In our hurry to get from one place to another, we failed to see anything on the way. Air travel gives you a bird’s-eye view of the world D or even less if the wing of the aircraft happens to get in your way. When you travel by car or train a blurred image of the countryside constantly smears the windows. And as for sea travel, it hardly deserves mention. It is perfectly summed up in the words of the old song: “I joined the navy to see the world, and what did I see? I saw the sea.” The typical twentieth-century traveler is the man who always says “I’ve been there.” You mention the remotest, most evocative place and someone is bound to say “I’ve been there” D meaning, “I drove through it at 100 miles an hour on the way to somewhere else.”
            When you travel at high speeds, the present means nothing: you live mainly in the future because you spend most of your time looking forward to arriving at some other place. By traveling like this, you suspend all experience; the present ceases to be a reality: you might just as well be dead. The traveler on foot, on the other hand, lives constantly in the present. For him traveling and arriving are one and the same thing: he arrives somewhere with every step he makes. He experiences the present moment with his eyes, his ears and the whole of his body. At the end of his journey he feels a delicious physical weariness. He knows that sound. Satisfying sleep will be his: the just reward of all true travelers.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            When Rupert Murdoch sees beams of light in the American advertising market, it is not necessarily time to reach for the sunglasses. Last October, when the impact of September 11th was only beginning to tell, the boss of NewsCorp, a media group, had already identified “strong rays of sunshine”. With ad sales still languishing, Mr. Murdoch declared last month that “there are some hints of a modest upswing in the U.S. advertising markets.” His early optimism turned out to be misplaced. Now, however, other industry observers are beginning to agree with him.
            Advertising usually exaggerates the economic cycle: falling sharply and early in a downturn, and rebounding strongly once the economy has begun to recover. This is because most managers prefer to trim their ad budgets rather than their payrolls, and restore such spending only once they feel sure that things are looking up. Last year, America’s ad market shrank by 9.8%, according to CMR, a research firm. Although ad spending has not yet recovered across all media, some analysts now expect overall ad spending to start to grow in the third quarter.
            The signs of improvement are patchy, however. Ad spending on radio and television seems to be inching up ― advertising on American national radio was up 2% in January on the same period last year, according to Aegis ― while spending on magazines and newspapers is still weak. Even within any one market, there are huge differences; just pick up a copy of one of the now-slimline high-tech magazines that once bulged with ads, and compare it with the hefty celebrity or women’s titles. Advertisers in some categories, such as the travel industry, are still reluctant to buy space or airtime, while others, such as the car and movie businesses, have been bolder. The winter Olympics, held last month in Salt Lake City, has also distorted the spending on broadcast advertising in the first quarter.
            Nonetheless, there is an underlying pattern. One measure is the booking of ad spots for national brands on local television. By early March, according to Mr. Westerfield’s analysis, such bookings were growing fast across eight out of the top ten advertising sectors, led by the financial and motor industries. UBS Warburg now expects the “upfront” market, which starts in May when advertisers book advance ad spots on the TV networks for the new season in September, to be up 4% on last year. On some estimates, even online advertising could pick up by the end of the year.

    C) There is no need to worry about economy now.
