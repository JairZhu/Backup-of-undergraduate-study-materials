    Script: What's the difference between being ambitious or competitive? Some people are competitive by nature. They grew up playing sports, knew they had to study hard and be the top of their class, and now put that same mindset into their jobs or businesses. This makes me wonder, is “competitive” a good thing or a bad thing? Some people are content with their lives just the way they are, never striving for more and never challenging themselves. So is it better to be described as commonplace or competitive? Are the words competitive and ambitious interchangeable?

    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: Do you feel that you are limited or tired? If yes, then it is time for you to begin realizing your dreams and desires. Believe in miracles. Hence ask yourself what you really wish for. Go for the biggest thing you have ever wanted. Feel that you have lots of opportunities because you have belief that you can achieve them. This way you encourage yourself to move in the direction of your goals. Carry this feeling of manifesting your dreams in your daily life.

    If you always think low, you are bound to realize the same. If you aim for the top and think about it, you will attract the same. You will get what you ask for. Believe me this is very true. It is similar to shopping for clothes. You go to a store, choose what you want and take it home. Similar way is with your vision. Visualize what you want, think about it and you will get it for sure. You have the freedom to choose and make your life better.

    What you need to do is stretch your impression about yourself. The way others see you will be far different from what you see yourself as. When your higher self takes control of you, you don’t think limitedly. Aim for the highest and ask for help. When you do this you challenge the universe if this is the highest for you. This can be done for any goals and wishes that you want to fulfill.
