    Script:         The Winter War was a military conflict between the Soviet Union and Finland. It began with a Soviet offensive on 30 November 1939 and ended on 13 March 1940 with the Moscow Peace Treaty. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the League on 14 December 1939.
            The Soviet forces had three times as many soldiers as the Finns, 30 times as many aircraft, and a hundred times as many tanks. The Red Army, however, had been crippled by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin’s Great Purge of 1937, reducing the army’s morale and efficiency shortly before the outbreak of the fighting. With more than 30,000 of its army officers executed or imprisoned, including most of those of the highest ranks, the Red Army in 1939 had many inexperienced senior officers. Because of these factors, and high commitment and morale in the Finnish forces, Finland was able to resist the Soviet invasion for far longer than the Soviets expected.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            We are all inclined to believe that our generation is more civilized than the generation that preceded ours. From time to time, there is even some substantial evidence that we hold in higher regard such civilized attributes as compassion, pity, remorse (懊悔), intelligence and a respect for the customs of people different from ourselves.
            Why war then?
            Some pessimistic historians think the whole society of man runs in cycles and that one of the phases is war. The optimists, on the other hand, think war is not like an eclipse (日食) or a flood or a spell of bad weather. They believe that it is more like a disease for which a cure could be found if the causes were known.
            Because war is the ultimate drama of life and death stories and pictures of it are more interesting than those about peace. This is so true that all of us, and perhaps those of us in television more than most, are often caught up in the action of war to the exclusion of the ideas of it.
            If it is true, as we would like to think it is, that our age is more civilized than ages past, we must all agree that it’s very strange that in the twentieth century, our century, we have killed more than 70 million of our fellowmen on purpose, at war. It is very strange that since 1900 more men have killed more other men than in any other seventy years in history.
            Probably the reason we are able to do both, that is, believe on the one hand that we are more civilized and on the other hand wage war to kill D is that killing is not so personal an affair as it once was. The enemy is invisible. One man doesn’t look another in the eye and run him through with a sword. The enemy dead or alive is largely unseen. He is killed by remote control: a loud noise, a distant puff of smoke and then silence.
            The pictures of the victim’s wife and children, which he carries in his breast pocket, are destroyed with him. He is not heard to cry out. The question of compassion or pity or remorse does not enter into it. The enemy is not a man; he is a statistic. It is true, too, that more people are being killed at war now than previously because we’re better at doing it than we used to be. One man with one modern weapon can kill thousands.



    31.

    A) people are more cruel  
    B) people don’t care others’ lives

    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            As traditionally grown, under a canopy (株冠) of shade trees and amid other vegetation, coffee is an environmentally-friendly crop. The shade trees fix nitrogen in the soil, fostering the growth of the coffee bushes, and their fallen leaves provide nutrients, further reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. The mixture of vegetation prevents erosion and protects the coffee from harsh weather. In contrast to corn and cattle, which almost always require clear-cutting, coffee can be grown in relative harmony with the rain forest.
            Recently, however, many coffee farmers in northern Latin America have reduced or eliminated shade to grow new high-yielding coffee plants under direct sun. Fear of a disease known as coffee leaf rust sparked an early round of conversions, most of which took place in the 1970s. To prevent the spread of the disease, coffee farmers "technified," replacing older, shade-loving coffee varieties, with new varieties, packed in tight hedgerows, that can survive open sun ― but only with chemical inputs.
            Coffee leaf rust never turned out to be a major problem for Latin America. To boost farmers' incomes, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) spent some $80 million from the 1970s to the early 1990s, according to a report (1996) from the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center and the Natural Resources Defense Council, to help growers in Central America and the Caribbean technify. In countries where USAID was not involved, national coffee federations promoted the change, supporting the technification of 69 percent of Colombia's coffee and nearly 40 percent of Costa Rica's.



    36.
    	
    Growing coffee plants under shade ______.
    A) helps them absorb oxygen from the soil  
    B) provides nutrients for other trees  
    C) reduces the need for chemical fertilizers

    正确答案： C
    37.

    A) it can stand harsh weather  
    B) it can be grown together with other plants  
    C) it doesn't need any chemical fertilizer  
    D) it will not erode in the forest  

    正确答案： B
    38.
    	
    Many coffee farmers shifted to growing coffee plants under direct sun in the 1970s ______.
    A) out of the fear of the spread of coffee leaf rust  
    B) because it was more profitable  
    C) as new varieties of coffee plants were developed  
    D) to decrease chemical inputs  

    正确答案： A
    39.
    	
    Coffee leaf rust ______.
    A) was a great hit to the coffee industry  
    B) cannot be eliminated by chemical fertilizers  
    C) didn't constitute a big problem for Latin America

    正确答案： C
    40.
    	
    Many coffee farmers turned to sun coffee ______.
    A) as a result of the widespread of coffee leaf rust  
    B) because it brought about higher profit
