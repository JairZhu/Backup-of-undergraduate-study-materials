    Script:         Sometimes I have thought it would be an excellent rule to live each day as if we should die tomorrow. Such an attitude would emphasize sharply the values of life. We should live each day with gentleness, vigor, and a keenness of appreciation which are often lost when time stretches before us in the constant panorama of more days and months and years to come. There are those who, of course, who would adopt the epicurean (享乐者) motto of "Eat, drink, and be merry," but most people would be chastened (磨练) by the certainty of impendent death. It has often been noted that those who live, or have lived, in the shadow of death bring a mellow sweetness to everything they do. Most of us, however, take life for granted. We know that one day we must die, but usually we picture that day as far in the future. When we are in buoyant (乐观的) health, death is all but unimaginable. We seldom think of it. The days stretch out in an endless vista. So we go about petty tasks, hardly aware of our listless attitude toward life.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Adrian's "Amazing Race" started early when his parents realized that he, as a baby, couldn't hear a thing, not even loud noises. In a special school for the hearing-impaired, he learned sign language and got to mix with other disabled children. However, the sight of all the disabled children communicating with one another upset his mother. She wanted him to lead a normal life. So after speaking to an advisor, she sent him to private classes where he learned to read lips and pronounce words.
            Later on, Adrian's parents decided to send him to a regular school. But the headmaster tried to prevent them from doing so; saying regular school couldn't take care of special needs students. His parents were determined to take the risk and push him hard to go through his work everyday because they wanted to prove that, given the opportunity, he could do anything. Adrian made the grade and got accepted. It was a big challenge. The pace was faster so he had to sit at the front of the class and really pay attention to the teacher, which wasn't always easy. But he stuck to it and did a lot of extra work after school.
            The efforts made by Adrian and his parents paid off. Adrian graduated with good grades and got into a top high school. He also achieved a lot in life outside school. He developed a love for the outdoors and went to Nepal to climb mountains. He even entered the World Yacht Race 05/06 C being the first hearing-impaired Asian to do so.
            But none of these achievements would have been possible without one of the most important lessons from his mother. "If you believe in yourself and work hard, you can achieve great results." She often said.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Helen Admas Keller (1880 ― 1968), is an outstanding example of a person who conquered physical disabilities. A serious illness, which her doctor called "acute congestion of the stomach and brain," destroyed her sight and hearing at the age of about one. For almost five years, she grew up, as she later said, "wild and unruly, giggling and chuckling to express pleasure; kicking, scratching, uttering the choked screams of the deaf-mute to indicate the opposite." Then Helen's father took her to Alexander Graham Bell. He advised Keller to write to the Perkins Institution for the Blind in Boston. Shortly before the child was 7, Anne Sullivan arrived from Boston to teach her, who remained with Helen Keller until her death. Then Mary Agnes "Polly" Thomson, who had been Keller's secretary, took Sullivan's place.
            First she learned to write. Sullivan was able to make contact with the girl's mind through the sense of touch. Gradually, the child was able to connect words with objects. Once she understood, her progress was rapid. Then she learned to speak. Until she was 10 years old, Keller could talk only with the sign language of the deaf-mute. She decided she would learn to speak and took lessons from a teacher of the deaf. By the time she was 16, she could communicate well enough to go to preparatory school and to college. Finally she helped others. After college, Keller became concerned with the conditions of the blind and the deaf-blind. She became active on the staffs of the American Foundation for the blind and of the American Foundation for overseas Blind. In her later years, she became especially interested in bettering the conditions for the blind in developing and war-ravaged countries. An enthusiastic and untiring traveler, she lectured on their behalf in more than 25 countries on every continent except Antarctica.
            Keller received many awards of great distinction. They include the Chevalier's ribbon of the French Legion of Honor, the Alumni Achievement Award of Radcliffe College, and decorations from many governments.
