    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            Pop stars today enjoy a style of living which was once the prerogative only of Royalty. Wherever they go, people turn out in their thousands to greet them. The stars are transported in their chauffeur driven Rolls-Royces, private helicopters or executive airplanes. All their comings and goings are reported, for, like Royalty, pop stars are news. If they enjoy many of the privileges of Royalty, they certainly share many of the inconveniences as well. They must be constantly shielded from the adoring crowds which idolize them. They are no longer private individuals, but public property. The financial rewards they receive for this sacrifice cannot be calculated, for their rates of pay are astronomical.
            And why not? Society has always rewarded its top entertainers lavishly. The great days of Hollywood have become legendary: famous stars enjoyed fame, wealth and adulation on an unprecedented scale. By today’s standards, the excesses of Hollywood do not seem quite so spectacular. A single gramophone record nowadays may earn much more in royalties than the films of the past ever did. The competition for the title “Top of the Pops” is fierce, but the rewards are truly colossal.
            It is only right that the stars should be paid in this way. Don’t the top men in industry earn enormous salaries for the services they perform to their companies and their countries? Pop stars earn vast sums in foreign currency ― often more than large industrial concerns ― and the taxman can only be grateful for their massive annual contributions to the national treasury. So who would begrudge them their rewards?
            People who make envious remarks should remember that the most famous stars represent only the tip of the iceberg. For every famous star, there are hundreds of others struggling to earn a living. A man working in a steady job and looking forward to a pension at the end of it has no right to expect very high rewards. He has chosen security and peace of mind, so there will always be a limit to what he can earn. But a man who attempts to become a star is taking enormous risks. He knows at the beginning that only a handful of competitors ever get to the very top. He knows that years of concentrated effort may be rewarded with complete failure. But he knows, too, that the rewards for success are very high indeed: they are the recompense for the huge risks involved and if he achieves them, he has certainly earned them. That’s the essence of private enterprise.

    31.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            Imagine eating everything delicious you want ― with none of the fat. That would be great, wouldn’t it?
            New “fake fat” products appeared on store shelves in the United States recently, but not everyone is happy about it. Makers of the products, which contain a compound called olestra (人造脂肪), say food manufacturers can now eliminate fat from certain foods. Critics, however, say the new compound can rob the body of essential vitamins and nutrients (营养物) and can also cause unpleasant side effects in some people. So it’s up to consumers to decide whether the new fat-free products taste good enough to keep eating.
            Chemists discovered olestra in the late 1960s, when they were searching for a fat that could be digested by infants more easily. Instead of finding the desired fat, the researchers created a fat that can’t be digested at all.
            Normally, special chemicals in the intestines (肠) "grab" molecules of regular fat and break them down so they can be used by the body. A molecule of regular fat is made up of three molecules of substances called fatty acids.
            The fatty acids are absorbed by the intestines and bring with them the essential vitamins A, D, E, and K. When fat molecules are present in the intestines with any of those vitamins, the vitamins attach to the molecules and are carried into the bloodstream.
            Olestra, which is made from six to eight molecules of fatty acids, is too large for the intestines to absorb. It just slides through the intestines without being broken down. Manufacturers say it’s that ability to slide unchanged through the intestines that makes olestra so valuable as a fat substitute. It provides consumers with the taste of regular fat without any bad effects on the body. But critics say olestra can prevent vitamins A, D, E, and K from being absorbed. It can also prevent the absorption of carotenoids (类胡萝卜素), compounds that may reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease, etc.
            Manufacturers are adding vitamins A, D, E, and K as well as carotenoids to their products now. Even so, some nutritionists are still concerned that people might eat unlimited amounts of food made with the fat substitute without worrying about how many calories they are consuming.

    36.
    	
    We learn from the passage that olestra is a substance that ______________.
    A) contains plenty of nutrients  
    B) renders foods calorie-free while retaining their vitamins  
    C) makes foods easily digestible  
    D) makes foods fat-free while keeping them delicious  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    The result of the search for an easily digestible fat turned out to be ______________.
    A) commercially useless  
    B) just as anticipated  
    C) somewhat controversial  
    D) quite unexpected  

    正确答案： D
    38.
    	
    Olestra is different from ordinary fats in that ______________.
    A) it passes through the intestines without being absorbed  
    B) it facilitates the absorption of vitamins by the body  
    C) it helps reduce the incidence of heart disease  
    D) it prevents excessive intake of vitamins  

    正确答案： A
    39.
    	
    What is a possible negative effect of olestra according to some critics? 
    A) It may impair the digestive system.  
    B) It may affect the overall fat intake.  
    C) It may increase the risk of cancer.  
    D) It may spoil the consumers’ appetite.  

    正确答案： C
    40.
    	
    Why are nutritionists concerned about adding vitamins to olestra? 
    A) It may lead to the over-consumption of vitamins.  
    B) People may be induced to eat more than what is necessary.  
    C) The function of the intestines may be weakened.  
    D) It may trigger a new wave of fake food production.  

    正确答案： B
