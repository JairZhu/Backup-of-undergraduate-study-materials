    Script:         The steam train represents the industrial revolution, and the scene of them in Jiayang of southwest China's Sichuan Province may cure nostalgia for people reminiscing about the good old days. Every day, sounds of rhythmic “ding-dang” “ding-dang” are heard from the steep mountains in Jianwei County of Sichuan’s Leshan City. An old-fashioned steam train staggers its carriages along Mt. Leshan on a narrow trail, blissfully indicating its presence to the outside world.
            Until now, the small old steam train is still the only means of transportation connecting the old mining area with the outside world, and it is the only steam train carrying passengers running on such a narrow trail. Built alongside the mountain, the railway features a narrower trail, with more turns and steeper gradients than the modern railway.
            Set aside all the characteristics, even the train station can carry you back into the 18th century. You will see an all-manual controlled old-fashioned train D shoveling coal by hand, handbrakes, and hand set telephone. Flag sign and whistles are the only command for guiding passengers to get on and off the train.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Because Ireland is an island geographically near the mainland of the United Kingdom, English rulers have fought since the Middle-English Ages to retain political control over it. Attracted by the lush farmland, English and Scottish landowners settled there, and in time of famine or political unrest, the local workers suffered, while their landlords were cushioned by their wealth. The history of modern Ireland is, in fact, largely a story of antagonism and resentment between the Irish and their English and Scottish rulers.
            Since the 1920s, Ireland has been divided into two parts: Northern Ireland (Ulster) and the Republic of Ireland (Eire). The north is still part of the United Kingdom and is predominantly Protestant; the south is an independent republic and is mainly Catholic. The majority in Ulster accept this political compromise, but the active and mainly Catholic minority are fighting for union with the independent republic of Southern Ireland. The IRA, the Irish Republican Army, have mounted bombing campaigns in military and civil targets in Ulster and England. They have sent letter-bombs to public figures, they have shot fellow Irishmen who support the British or belong to opposing, and now equally militant Protestant groups. As a result of this, the British have stationed an army in Belfast, the IRA have been outlawed, and several of them have spent many years in prison or have died in support of their cause. Whether this level of violence and repression is justifiable, and whether the violence that could result from political change would be worthwhile are the controversial issues that divide everybody involved.



    31.
    	
    It suggested that the central problem is the relationship between _________.
    A) Britain and Ireland  
    B) Ulster and Eire  
    C) Catholics and Protestants

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            The past ages of man have all been carefully labeled by anthropologists. When the time comes for anthropologists to turn their attention to the twentieth century, they will surely choose the label “Legless Man”.
            Histories of the time will go something like this: “in the twentieth century, people forgot how to use their legs. Men and women moved about in cars, buses and trains from a very early age. There were lifts and escalators in all large buildings to prevent people from walking. The surprising thing is that they didn’t use their legs even when they went on holiday. They built cable railways, ski-lifts and roads to the top of every huge mountain. All the beauty spots on earth were marred by the presence of large car parks.”
            The future history books might also record that we were deprived of the use of our eyes. In our hurry to get from one place to another, we failed to see anything on the way. Air travel gives you a bird’s-eye view of the world D or even less if the wing of the aircraft happens to get in your way. When you travel by car or train a blurred image of the countryside constantly smears the windows. And as for sea travel, it hardly deserves mention. It is perfectly summed up in the words of the old song: “I joined the navy to see the world, and what did I see? I saw the sea.” The typical twentieth-century traveler is the man who always says “I’ve been there.” You mention the remotest, most evocative place and someone is bound to say “I’ve been there” D meaning, “I drove through it at 100 miles an hour on the way to somewhere else.”
            When you travel at high speeds, the present means nothing: you live mainly in the future because you spend most of your time looking forward to arriving at some other place. By traveling like this, you suspend all experience; the present ceases to be a reality: you might just as well be dead. The traveler on foot, on the other hand, lives constantly in the present. For him traveling and arriving are one and the same thing: he arrives somewhere with every step he makes. He experiences the present moment with his eyes, his ears and the whole of his body. At the end of his journey he feels a delicious physical weariness. He knows that sound. Satisfying sleep will be his: the just reward of all true travelers.
